"I have 4 kids- all boys. I’m constantly telling them to use their napkins & eat over their plates. Do they? Of course not. I use my little green machine to clean their dinner chairs monthly along with other upholstery cleaners but they were permanently stained… or so I thought. I was ready to just replace the chairs but I got to thinking how amazing this product works on keeping my whites bright & getting stains out of my kids clothes. So I figured I’d try it out. SO glad I did!! Used a spoon of this with warm water along with a soft bristle brush and waaa-la!! They look good as new & saved me a couple hundred on new chairs! BEST $5 ever spent! I’m ready to use this on everything in my house now!*FYI- after years of shopping on amazon, this is the only review I’ve ever done because I’m THAT in love with the product! If I can save another mom from wanting to rip her hair out looking at her kids messes then this review is worth it!",positive,washing powder
"Was surprised how well this works. Purchased as an alternative to Borax, after Ordering Borax and it being Delivered to some other State. These Soda Boosters seem to work well, removing Stains, as well as Odors. The Negative is that they also remove the Dye from the Materials, have some Black T-Shirts that have significantly lost Color due to use of this Product.However, had the same Shirts, have a sour smell in the collar due to being left in the Washer or not Dried Completely and then wearing in Summer as Gardening Shirts, as those discussed are Long Sleeve Shirts. This Powder removed much of that smell, which Laundry Detergent did not seem to ever completely remove. Was actually surprised that the A&H was able to do so.Everything seemingly has a purpose, these appear to be for hard to remove Stains, Work Clothes, or Heavy Soiled Items. These Soda Powders do not seem to leave that film, that is left by OxyStain Products, if you have used those types of Stain Removers?Will Repurchase this Item for Heavy Stained Items.",positive,washing powder
I was looking for a non toxic option for laundry detergent so I make my own detergent now  with peppermint oil and baking soda and this and it’s been working great! I did dilute a cup in a gallon and washed my tile with it BUT it left white streaks and then I went over it again with just water and it cleared right up. I love it because it has a lot of purposes and it’s 100% clean ingredient,positive,washing powder
This is by far one of Arm and Hammers best products. This makes doing laundry worth wild. My clothes comes out fresh and bright.,positive,washing powder
I like this product due to it making detergent more effective for me with well water. It is hard for laundry detergent to get into clothing with a well with the minerals. It makes a world of difference for me adding it to the washer. I don't believe it has a scent. I wish it were a bit cheaper.,positive,washing powder
This is my second purchase. Love it.,positive,washing powder
"Great for getting smells out. I add this to laundry detergent for washing dog beds, towels, etc. Works great but should be cheaper for what it is",positive,washing powder
"This has made a difference in cleanliness of my clothes. I have hard water and sometimes there was lingering smells and debris. This I feel helps water to be "" softer"" and in return I have cleaner more vibrant looking laundry.",positive,washing powder
I paid $24.49 for product on left from Amazon (3lb 7 oz) and $6.99 for product on right from Canadian Tire (6 lb 6oz). The reason I purchased the Amazon product was because I had trouble finding the product in Canada but will definitely stock up any time I find it on the shelves in my local Canadian Tire store!,negative,washing powder
This is one of my stupid buys. Pinterest happy....got this for to strip all the towels....yes well....lets just say... waste of time effort and energy for me. And im not blaming the product. Its a lovely large yellow box if white powder. And in fairness used in the washing machine with the whites do seem to make them brighter. The stripping thing i wasnt to pleased with tho. Either the towels werent that bad or the recipie was wrong who knows....all i know is there wasnt any noticable dirt coming from the towels. But there us a huge amount if powder in this box and i have used it for many other different uses. It was packaged very well and safe. Overlysized box pehaps was my biggest upset. But the product is still intact and still have some left. Not such a bad purchase after all,positive,washing powder
"I made my own laundry detergent with this and it turned out great (contains fels-naptha soap, borax substitue and washing soda).  Now that I have it in the house, I've been using it to clean my tile floors and hard surfaces in the bathroom, and it's just as good as cleaning products that cost way more and come packaged in huge plastic containers.",positive,washing powder
"I'm not sure it makes laundry better, but the clothes seem to feel harsh after adding it to a washHowever, i use it for cleaning my airfryer basket and it helps but three best use is sprinkling into the outdoor bin, definitely helps to illiminate pungent smells.Rather expensive though",neutral,washing powder
At last something that really works to clean towels and blankets used on a wet dog!  Items now smell clean and can be put away.,positive,washing powder
Gain is the only detergent I buy for my household,positive,washing powder
My favorite scent that lasts forever,positive,washing powder
Smells great and cleans well.,positive,washing powder
Changed to Gain because we noticed that Tide was fading out clothes and the Gain does not!,positive,washing powder
Leaves clothes smelling great,positive,washing powder
"I was expecting this to smell amazing. Like the liquid version of this.  It absolutely doesn’t, it does smell good, a clean fresh scent. Not the moonlight Breeze that you smells with the liquid detergent, scent beads or softner sheets.",negative,washing powder
"This last me a long time, gets my clothes really clean, I love it!",positive,washing powder
More washes for the cost then liquids. Cleans and smells great,positive,washing powder
"I was very hesitant to switch from liquid detergent to powder, but my husband kept putting the challenge in front of me. He swore that our clothes would be cleaner and fluffier. He was CORRECT!!! The powder gets down into the fabric which cleanes better! I recommend powder to everyone I know. Yes liquid is more user friendly, but..you will spend WAY LESS. You will be hooked :) why are we so stuck on liquid ?",positive,washing powder
"I refuse to use these stupid ""pods.""  They are NOT a good value and the appliance people tell us that they mess-up and in some cases damage washing machines beyond repair.  MUCH better value and better cleaning than the pods as well.",positive,washing powder
I am a lifelong tied user however I had purchased liquid tide for the last 20 years. First I barked at the price but then I saw it was good for 102 washes so I took the plunge!After much research on cleaning different surfaces from tile to wood fencing I found that powdered tide is the most effective so I bought it and it’s true! You can use it on any surface you please as long as you mix it with the proper ingredients .,positive,washing powder
"I like Tide powder, which is becoming harder to find. There's a difference between the powder and liquid in scent, cleaning and price.  You cannot beat the clean smell of Tide in the wash and Downey as the fabric rince.",positive,washing powder
I’ve been watching videos from home that use this when cleaning that way your house will smell more of a clean smell and not just chemicals . I love using this for laundry as well but mainly for cleaning this is what I bought it for!,positive,washing powder
"No worry about diluted, watered down detergent.. this lasts and lasts and really works well to clean, deodorize and white clothes. Great deal !",positive,washing powder
One of the best detergents you can buy. Keep your clothes smell good and clean.,positive,washing powder
"Oh my God guys, this was so big, I didn’t expect it for this small price, I highly recommend",positive,washing powder
This is the best smelling laundry detergent! The brand is very popular in Latin America so I was very excited to try this version with Downey. This detergent cleans well and you don't need to use too much so 158 Oz will last a while.,positive,washing powder
"This really smells nice and cleans well, it doesn’t come with a scooper and it’s in a big bag.My bag was punctured a little so there was detergent that was spilled. Not a lot but I had to put it into a container and it doesn’t come with a scooper or measuring device. Those are the cons.Overall, smells nice,  and cleans well.Just need to put it into a different container.",positive,washing powder
"Unfortunately, my soap was punctured and made quite a mess. However I was able to salvage 95% of the detergent.I normally refuse to get scented detergent but grabbed this, planning to use on just towels. I am so glad I did. Whole I normally don't like scented detergent, this smells soooo good. Towels came out soft, clean, and smelling amazing. I won't use it on our clothes because of sensitive skin but so far, no issues with towels.",positive,washing powder
"This is interesting detergent. When I first saw the packaging andbhow it was labeled with a touch of Downey, I wondered if it was a version of Tide from another country. It is made by P&G. But on further research, I learned it is more like Gain than Tide.It is very fine and looks like powder. I use powdered detergent and it is coarser than this. It is also very blue whereas the powder I uluse is white with some blue specks. I don't know fir sure but I suspect that means that it has a lot of bluing in it. Bluing in the detergent makes whites look whiter. You can actually buy bluing on its own to use on white clothing.The package says to use 1/4 C for normal soiled medium sized loads. In looking at the P&G website, they recommend 2T or 1/8 of a cup for an HE washer, so half as much. Using that, my load of towels came out clean. They did seem a little rougher than usual. We don't use fabric softener on towels but I do throw in 1/2C of baking soda. This helps to cut any body oils or soils and softens the towels without reducing the absorbancy. The roughness doesn't seem bad but I will rewash them to see if they are still rough.The scent is great. Overall, I am satisfied with this detergent. Although I am a Tide girl, I know that most of my family's clothes aren't that dirty. With orices now a days, this detergent could save me some money if I use it on normally soiled clothing.",positive,washing powder
"I'm not used to using powdered laundry detergent.  I've gotten accustomed to just using pods, but this has really changed my mind! For a large load, about a half laundry cup of Ariel, with a Touch of Downy Freshness gets the job done in my top loader.  Laundry comes out smelling clean and fresh, and I really can't ask for more.  I also have not had any issues with any sensitivity to the product either.  I will say though that this is a very large bag - with enough for allegedly 99 loads.  I wish this came in a container with an easier to open and close mechanism.  I strongly recommend opening the bag very carefully with a scissors and a chip-clip works well for me to keep the bag securely closed.  Really great value here and this smells better than the leading brands. I've never heard of Ariel, but I am a fan of Downy dryer sheets so I gave this a try and am not disappointed in the least!",positive,washing powder
"besides the scent, which is really love, the most important thing to me when using a powder is if it rinses clean and completely off.  I had powder detergent stick to my clothes, towels, sheets etc becuase it didn't rinse off in the washer so I was a bit sceptical about using powders again.  This rinses completely off, not a trace !  The scent is heavenly.  I just love it.  My husband has sensitive skin and he loves scented clothes but they do cause him to itch but so far, so good on this one.  I did sheets and 2 loads of towels and one load of just his white tee shirts and no complaints.  This is a very good value, the bag is large.  When I did my towels, they seemed extra soft.  I have 2 brands that i use all the time but I think I might add this one to my list.  Every thing about it was good.  by the way, the scent is not overwhelming either.  It's just a nice, fresh clean scent.",positive,washing powder
"I first want to say I like the scent of this detergent. It is a large size and does a lot of loads. The powder is small so it dissolves fast in the water. It washes well and leaves a light scent on the clothes once they come out of the dryer. If I had one negative thing to say it would be that all of the writing is in Spanish, so if you know no Spanish whatsoever, you can't understand anything on the package. It would be better if they put English writing along with the Spanish on the pack. I would still recommend this product.",positive,washing powder
"I bought this after reading reviews, hoping it would work for getting my husband’s polyester work shirts fresh smelling. I wanted to try this more economical option before trying a pricey sport detergent made for activewear. After multiple wears and washes, his work shirts had a build up which left them smelling funky even after washing. We already use detergent with this ingredient in it, but adding extra of this product, washing in hot, and doing a soak has made a huge difference. He no longer complains about his clothes having a funky smell and has been very pleased!",positive,washing powder
I tried  the original version advertised by infomercial like commercials when this product came out several years ago. I wasn’t that impressed. My normal laundry booster was out of stock. After a bit of googling I decided to give it a fresh try.  This stuff gives your basic laundry detergent the ultimate “Glow Up”. Clothes smell amazing days after being out away in your closet or drawer. The scent is amazing. It’s a “sporty fresh clean” with a sprinkle of scent that is so familiar it feels like a warm hug. It’s a new laundry staple that I never knew I needed.,positive,washing powder
Product container was open in the shipping box. I was able to salvage most of the  powder from the shipping box back to its container.  Container had no seal (tape) on the lid and wasn't in a plastic bag.Great product when you can use it!,positive,washing powder
I like the size and actually it works very well on my towels since I have dogs. Dog smell is hard to get out. This product is a good brand good size and well worth if your clothes smell like your pets. I as well cleaned my washing machine to make sure it wasn't just that. It was the dogs left over scent on towels. There are some soaps that do not get out that perfume smell or cologne smell or sweat smell and dog smell.....plus my sinuses hurt when it's to perfumie. This is mild enough for me.,positive,washing powder
"It amazes me the amount of oxiclean in the bag it came wrapped in. Which lets you know it is an issue with the containers not staying closed and leaking out contents.Ive been buying and using oxiclean with odor blasters for a while now. It gets my greasy/grimey work clothes clean and keeps them smelling fresh after washing. After a full day of work in the summer, you could imagine how stinky and sweaty the clothes can get. A scoop of this stuff in the wash makes them fresh again!",positive,washing powder
This did a great job . Really protects the colors and gives the clothes a nice fresh scent (not overpowering).,positive,washing powder
My gym clothes were coming out of the wash still smelling and I was losing my mind wondering if my washing machine wasn't holding up. Turns out I'm stinkier than I realized and my gym clothes were not getting any help sitting in the hamper a day or 2. This product has worked great to remove the smell and I use it just for my gym clothes load. I was skeptical but what an easy fix!,positive,washing powder
This is a great product if you have athletes in your family that have sweaty dirty clothes. It handles the strong odors from my teenage football and basketball playing son. The price on Amazon beat Wal Mart price too.,positive,washing powder
"Gets the smell out of anything. Need to use warm or hot water with your wash, so not good for cold wash only items.",positive,washing powder
"IMO, you need to really consider powder detergent especially if you have a high-efficiency washing machine.  I used the Ariel Original powder detergent (which is now my #1 go-to for everyday clothes) and had to try this OXI version, too. I have a HE Maytag top loader with the option of deep fill.  I used to use deep fill often, which uses more water and detergent per load.  I did this mostly because I couldn't get a good deep clean for my kid/dog/hubby clothes on the regular HE option.  No More!  This detergent gives me a perfect deep clean with the HE option!My laundry nemesis is sports clothing, especially my Athleta gear and my hubby's BJJ gi.  These are expensive products that can't take harsh detergents or bleach. I’ve used many different brands of detergents for these items. I tried just about every treatment and remedy to get sweat stains and smells out of the gi out with no change. Based on my great results with Original Ariel powder, I tried this Ariel with Ultra Oxi powder. Imagine my surprise when it took out the sweat stains and gym smells, without fading the trim or patches! No pretreat or additive was needed.  My Athleta gear also came out fresh and clean, with all the fabric's wicking properties intact (did not use fabric softener). Also took the consistent dinginess out of my white bath towels.  I used it to wash some smelly kids' shoes and dog towels--everything came out clean and fresh!Additionally, it's more environmentally friendly with less water in the manufacturing process and the thin plastic bag vs a plastic jog. I poured my bag of detergent into an old laundry pod detergent container, and it works great.  And, have you looked at the amount you need per load? You need only a little bit. You get a lot of loads in one small bag.Next big thing: it dissolves beautifully, even in cold water! Because our winter cold water is painfully cold, I do sometimes dissolve the powder in some hot water, but I'm not sure you need to do that. And the scent is quite fresh and clean and not overpowering. It rinses clean with no residue in the drum. Of course, it deep cleans and the clothes look great. Colored clothes are bright and whites are truly white, not dyed blue. It also appears to be gentle on clothes, with no pilling or fading. In fact, a lot of my clothes and towels looked better than ever after 1 wash.Let's talk price--I can't believe you can get such a high-quality detergent at such a fair price (at the time I wrote this the price per load was about 15 cents).So, I really think Ariel with Ultra Oxi is an excellent product, and if you haven’t tried it you definitely should!Hope you found this review helpful!",positive,washing powder
"$9 is a great deal for a bag of laundry detergent this big, and it lasts a long time. Its laundry detergent particles are relatively large, but the washing is still quite clean, and it leaves a fragrance. It's a pity that if you wash it by hand, you will find that your hands are very rough after washing. If you wash it in the washing machine, it is still recommended.",positive,washing powder
"Has a very nice clean smell, works well with hugh efficiency washers",positive,washing powder
"I guess I misunderstood the pkg pictures and thought these were little wrapped pkts of powder detergent. If you thought so too, don't be confused when you simply receive a large bag of powder detergent. The detergent is simple and works well. It is definitely fragranced, like a traditional soapy smell similar to that Irish bar soap.",positive,washing powder
"This is good laundry detergent. I like that it contains Oxi, so it will help get out stains. I need to use powder detergent because I have a small washing machine and the little pods have too much in them for me. This has a nice scent, I would describe as fresh. It's not overpowering, but also you can smell it slightly on your washed clothes, which I like because they feel fresh. The bag is slightly thin, but I remedied that by putting the entire bag into a jumbo slider freezer bag and it fits with room to spare. If you're going to the laundromat you can scoop some into a smaller baggie to take with. This will be my new go-to laundry detergent.",positive,washing powder
"I’m surprisingly pleased with this laundry detergent. I’m a little finicky when it comes to laundry soap — and was a little skeptical ordering it off of Amazon. It has to work, not cause any irritation to my skin, and it has to smell good. This stuff delivers on all three! And a bonus that I can now order it and have it delivered right to my door!!My only recommendation is if you have a front loader washing machine, put it in the drum before anything else to avoid it getting trapped in the clothes and clumping up.",positive,washing powder
I love this detergent!  It cleans well and smells fantastic.  I use the Oxy Ariel on my whites and regular on my colors.  It smells so good and fresh.,positive,washing powder
"Smells GREAT! Very clean fresh scent - I use this on heavier loads of laundry in lieu of my pods. It just works nicely for socks, undies, towels and sheets. I moved it into a different container however, because it just comes in a non-resealable bag, which does NOT work for storage and use. As long as you have something to transfer it to, its great!",positive,washing powder
"clothes smell good and the fragance lasts along time, good price.",positive,washing powder
Great value for the money as well as wonderful smell.,positive,washing powder
This is the freshest scent I’ve found and it lasts.,positive,washing powder
"Half the soap was in package it was shipped I lost slot of it on the floor this was not good, not sur how it got so messed up but losing some did not make me happu",negative,washing powder
Just as described,neutral,washing powder
This box of detergent is unusable.  It came sealed in plastic but the contents is clumpy and and hard chunks.  I want a refund.,negative,washing powder
Seriously... isn’t that price gouging!!! 30 dollars for 80loads!!,negative,washing powder
"I am writing this review with a new found purpose in life... For up until a few hours ago I was on a willmaker .com planning my ultimate demise. I had bequeathed all my worldly possessions... including  but not limited to a television, router, and top Ramen.... to my teenage son. With a heavy heart and peaceful soul I accept my fate at the hands of his socks.... those mismatched, stained, dingy, putrid, stench ridden vessels of the apocalypse...  the only thing left to do is wait for the toxins in the air to reach my bloodstream...  for it is laundry day.(Enter Molly's stage left)  A bag of Molly's rests atop a milky white washing machine. A gift from the gods perhaps... a beacon of hope in a otherwise futile world.... using what little strength I can muster; I physically touch the encrusted Hanes-ish vessel and fling it in the direction from which the bright light of Molly eminates. With a loud crack the projectile ricochets off the lid and into the washer. I quickly lock the lid preventing the hell spawn demon sock from escaping its sterile citrus fresh tomb... As the fill cycle begins, I can almost hear the wails of defeat from the dark abyss.I run quickly outside to escape the green haze of stench and fill my lungs with the cool,  fresh, air.  The neighbors staring at the wild-eyed woman trying her best not to hurl - I wave weakly and sit on the porch awaiting my fate... all too soon I hear the musical chimes that indicates that washer has done its best. To what carnage will I return to... shards of whirlpool embedded in the sheet rock? With the courage of s warrior I slowly make my way back into the once jubilant abode. Each step announces my feeble attempt at making peace with the sock.... step..... breathe..... step..... exhale.... the anticipation is stifling.... And then when all seems in vain....  the lid pops open...  a waft of fresh air passes through my senses. I am taken back to a joyous time.... a time of peace and tranquility.... void of hormones and sweat glands... all is right in the universe.  And watching all of this; still perched atop the washer sits the bag of Molly's. Triumphant in her battle vs. the sock.",positive,washing powder
"I am in the process of trying a number of different Molly's® Suds products, including the 2-in-1 Original Laundry Powder with Oxygen Brightener Boost. I use the Brightener as an additive or boost to the laundry detergent; I do not use it as the only detergent in the load. The Brightener has proven to be color safe. It probably brightens my color loads some, but I cannot tell by how much. I do think the Brightener helps to get my laundry clean. I love the fragrance, a nice, crisp, clean mix of peppermint and lemon. Overall, I think the product is effective, but I am not sure by how much. For example, I would not use the 2-in-1 Original Laundry Powder with Brightener alone to clean my laundry. I am happy enough with the product, however, to buy it again.",positive,washing powder
"I used a whole bag of powder before reviewing - After using tide pods and soaps for all my life, I am still going back and forth on this. I know this is definitely better for the environment and I don’t need to worry about a tide pod not fully disintegrating or any soap stains but I just don’t get that fresh clean smell or anything from using this powder so I go back and forth. After washing my dogs blankets, it sometimes still has a dog smell to it so I have to rewash again, which also makes me question if it’s actually fully cleaning my clothes. My clothes don’t smell like anything after washing which is fine but it’s not a satisfying clean smell so this may not be for you if you want clean laundry smell for the clothes but it is great for sensitive folks. Also it did leave some powder residue at the top of the washing machine, it did eventually wash away after I did more loads of laundry but it happens from time to time still. I don’t hate this though. I’m gonna still give it a chance and try another scent.",positive,washing powder
"I have sensitive skin and can't use the scented products normally but I can use this one. It has a mild peppermint scent that is very pleasant and doesn't aggravate my allergies or asthma. The best part is that it is very effective, I have not had good experiences with unscented/sensitive products. It seems like if it has to be for sensitive skin it loses something that makes it clean effectively. This product is not like that. I really like the product and would recommend it. I wanted to use one of the compressed products but this cleans much, much better. AND it does dissolve in cold water, no left over bits and grains of soap. A definite plus!!",positive,washing powder
I am so glad I ran across this product when searching for a detergent. I’m not a huge fan of the scent of the powder itself however after washing it doesn’t hang onto clothes. The best way I could describe it is that the clothes come out smelling like very very clean & fresh water. I previously used dreft and assumed that the little red bumps (baby eczema) was just Norma but it actually went away after switching. It seems like the bag will last a long time and is a good quantity for the price. Will definitely continue to purchase & look into other products as well.,positive,washing powder
"I use one scoop in my washing machine and my clothes come out clean and smelling fresh! I have a top loading machine so I add the powder while the water is running and mix it in before adding the clothes, otherwise there might be some white residue on the clothes when the cycle is finished.I’ve noticed I am a little itchier than normal so I’m going to try the un scented kind next, but I haven’t had a horrible reaction to the scent like I have with other brands.",positive,washing powder
"The cleaning power of this stuff is amazing. I find it works better when I use warm/hot water, I’m always shocked when I take my hubbys work clothes out of the wash and find them stain free! The scent is nice, but doesn’t last long on the clothes once they’ve been dries, but they do smell clean, just not the perfumey smells we’re all used to from the name brands. I’ve only tried the citrus scent so I can’t speak for the other scents but this one is pleasant and after dealing with covid, this one still smells normal to me so that’s a big plus!",positive,washing powder
This is a very concentrated product which is which why I mention the bag was not as big as I expected this was great as it does not take up much space.  When you open the bag there is quite a strong smell of peppermint oil but this does not carry over into the wash which was great for me as I don't want my wash to overpower me.  I have not done any muddy clothes but so far it is handling the normal wash great with clothes coming out as clean if not cleaner than normal washing powders.  I was annoyed with myself that the day after I ordered it I spotted a deal of 2 for 1 so check for deals i would say but otherwise it has been an excellent product.,positive,washing powder
"Literally there’s no going back for us! Although expensive, it definitely lasts for more than 70 loads as it is quite concentrated and I love the fact that it has few ingredients and all natural. The peppermint smell is only in the powder, once you’ve washed your clothes, they don’t have a perfume.",positive,washing powder
"I wanted to like this really bad but it sadly just doesn't do the job. I have sensitive skin and hoped this would be helping with that as well as with the cleaning but clothes didn't feel fresh and clean. Left white marks on the dark laundry. Went back to Ecover Zero or DP Liquid Soap Flakes. Both seems fine as it doesn't have strong smell or any at all...if you like scented ones, none of these would work for you.",negative,washing powder
"Our water is a little hard so this powder does not make any suds which are important for cleaning and disinfecting. There is a product (very old brand) similar to this in Home Bargains, probably a slightly different formulation but about half the price. Unfortunately I won't be buying this again. In fairness I use it for my running gear and I have to put in the anti bacterial stuff anyhow. Nowhere near as good as the Eco liquid stuff, apples and oranges perhaps but there you go. Their formulators need to think harder.",neutral,washing powder
"I hate companies that promote how good they are for the world then bump up their prices by 50% in less than 6 months. Its an ok product which was expensive to start with, now it is just for the people who have excess money to throw at things they probably don't need",negative,washing powder
