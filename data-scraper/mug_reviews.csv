For the price I was really expecting a lot more.  Coffee or water splashes out of the top no matter what I do.  I ended up having to purchase another lid.  I wasn't expecting it to hold liquid while upside down or anything crazy but just being held in a pouch on the side of a bag!  Or sitting in a cupholder!  It is fine on a desk but that's about it.,negative,mug
"I like this travel mug. I like its looks. I like the way it feels in hand. I like its performance.So why did I rate it 1 star? Why are they advertising it as 20 oz? It folds a maximum of 16 oz with the lid on. Even with the lid off I do not believe I would be able to add another half cup.You, Sir (YETI) lied! One star for you!",negative,mug
"I’ve owned many YETI products and found them to be generally very good-to-excellent. This Rambler 20 oz. Tumbler looks good but disappoints greatly in temperature retention performance. Though COLD liquids remain cold for a decent period of time (50-75 mins. Depending on Outside/Inside  Air Temperatures), HOT liquids are very poorly retained at original temperature. Hot Coffee or Hot Tea at normal consumption temperatures, for instance, become tepid within 15-25 mins at best.  Very poor performance compared to many competitors and very costly for product capability. This appears to be an item with a price point elevated for brand name only.",negative,mug
"This was expensive junk. It says its leak Proof but the maglid leaks all over. Just the slightest bump of the cup and liquid comes out of the switch.  I bought 2 so I know it’s not an individual defect, so I’m out $70 for a “leak proof” cup that leaks all over my cloth and car.",negative,mug
"My wife was given one as a gift a couple years ago. She wanted another one for traveling so I here we are. First time she used it, she complained she could barely hold it. Thinking she was just being her, one morning I made her a cup of coffee. I made it about halfway to the bedroom when my hand started to get uncomfortable. By time I made it to her, it felt like I had poured the coffee directly in my hand. I was able to keep a straight face as I set it on the nightstand, and when she asked if I noticed it being hot, I told her she was just being a wuss. SO,  Needless to say, she was right, as usual...... THIS IS  EITHER A DEFECT CUP  OR COPY CAT",negative,mug
"I was so excited to get my cup because I already  have the larger Yeti and I love it.  I got this version for my coffee.  I used a Contigo for 5 years and it never leaked and kept my coffee warm for hours.The first morning I used my new cup it spilled ALL over my work back and the contents in it (including electronics).  So I figured that I just can't put it in my bag.  I used it again, and I carried it this time.  Any tipping of the cup spills liquid, so I ended up with coffee all over my gloves, jacket, and work clothes.  Then when I got to work, in about 20 minutes, my coffee is barely luke-warm.  The first time I figured it was because so much spilled.This cup is NOT WORTH THE MONEY.  I was better off with my $8 Contigo, which I am going to purchase again!",negative,mug
I'm an adult woman with fairly small hands and I cannot hold this cup easily. It is just too large around.  It strains my hands and is uncomfortable.  And I must have been asleep when I ordered this.  It is FAR too expensive for a single cup.  There are many other more economical choices.,negative,mug
"My version does not keep liquids hot or cold for more than a few hours at most???!! I filled it half full with ice cubes, then added cold water to the brim closed the lid, and 2-3 hours later, the ice was gone and the water was at room temperature. The same is true with hot coffee. Is mine defective or is Yeti lowering its quality and resting on its reputation?",negative,mug
I thought I’d buy this Yeti for my son’s Christmas gift. I just received it in the mail and opened it to verify the product. The bag it comes in is open on one side and the magnaslider is completely missing!!!,negative,mug
"The info that came w the tumbler said that the lid is not leakproof. OK, understood. What I don’t understand is how it can leak when it’s in your hand and you’re standing still. I imagined it wouldn’t be leak proof if it’s in the truck and you’re off roading but when the act of standing in one place and trying to drink makes it leak it seems like a failed product.It doesn’t keep hot drinks hot the way my cheap Contigo brand tumbler does. There needs to be something around it to grip because it’s just slick stainless steel and it can slide from your hand easily. Do not even try opening the lid once you have a hot drink in there. Just don’t. Or wear an apron and do it in the sink because you have to force the lid open.$30. My no name tumbler from Walgreens is far superior.",negative,mug
"Sure, the lid doesn't leak if you test it with cold water, but add piping hot coffee and it leaks like a sieve.  Very disappointed in this Yeti product. Would be nice if they made a truly leakproof lid for it.",negative,mug
Bought it for christmas but it arrived all scuffed up and dented :/ the box was fine so it just shipped like that. pretty bummed. It's also missing the whole mouth cover thing???,negative,mug
"The tumbler arrived to me dented and scratched!  I purchased two, 2, tumblers to use as a cold beverage tumbler while vacationing in 95 plus degree weather, expecting it to perform like the hype of YETI, and that all their products are supposed to be outstanding.  This product is extremely disappointing.  The ice in the beverage did not even last 30 minutes.  All products put into the tumbler were straight out of the freezer or refrigerator and the ice was melted within 30 to 45 minutes and the beverage was warm within one hour, which made it undrinkable.  The lid it comes with is a clear plastic that offers very little in the form of insulation.  Were the tumbler to have an insulated non-clear lid, like I have with my thermos tumbler, it would have potential to be a much better insulated tumbler and perhaps a good product.  The clear plastic lid is what makes it a very disappointing YETI product.",negative,mug
"I was excited to receive this for Mother's Day from my kids, as I have been wanting a Yeti for a while. But, literally a few minutes after my hot coffee is in the rambler it is lukewarm. I have used a different Yeti before and this didn't happen. I tried pouring really hot water in to heat it before my hot coffee, but I get the same result. Cold coffee in minutes. So, I am not sure what is wrong here, but this doesn't work right. I tried cold water with ice as well, the ice was melted when I was outside for a bit. It was hot out, but I thought they were supposed to have the ice remain overnight?!? Really bummed that I got a dud.",negative,mug
I didn’t notice when I wrapped it but embarrassingly enough the recipient that I gifted it to for Christmas pointed it out to me!! Not Happy!,negative,mug
"In my opinion this is not a Yeti but a knock off. I have a Yeti and I immediately noticed the weight difference, Went to Dick's and bought a Yeti totally different in weight.",negative,mug
Tumbler did not come with Mag Slider. Sent email to Yeti 5 days ago and still no reply. Not good customer service. Sending back.,negative,mug
"After only a few months my yeti cup started getting rust spots on the bottom inside. I only use this for water, never anything else",negative,mug
"I paid double for my cup, knowing that it was extremely difficult to get a true red one right now.  The cup in the pic to the right is the brick red I was expecting!  I wanted a cup in brick or canyon red, they sent me a harvest colored one, which is the now common red (actually a purplish/red).  It's petty I know, but when you have a large family and you want every have their own cup, it's hard to know who is who's when the colors are the same!  It was the main reason that I was willing to pay double to avoid this!±!+±+3",negative,mug
"So we have magnets for added nerd tech feature.  Cool.  Unfortunately we forgot to check the fact that IT LEAKS!  It's not a little leak either.  It leaks a LOT.  Go look at the videos other reviewers were nice enough to put up.  If you need a cup that won't leak profusely, find a different cup.  I'm trying out Jura's.  It comes with two lids just so you can have a travel lid that DOESN'T leak if you're so inclined.Another bad part of the design is that the lid which leaks isn't that easy to clean under the sliding mechanism.  If you don't immediately rinse the lid after use (because the thing leaks so much) you'll find it won't slide because whatever you were drinking dried underneath it.So now for the good part.  Does the cup appear to insulate decently?  Yes.  Does that really matter when the lid sucks?  Not so much unless you have another lid to use since the Yeti one's garbage.",negative,mug
                    The media could not be loaded.                 This item didn’t even come with a lid. I’ve ordered yeti of Amazon so I trusted that it’d come with everything. This was supposed to be a Christmas gift. Now I’ve gotta spend extra money on lids just so that it comes with a lid.,negative,mug
I can say I am highly disappointed with the cup given the brand. The design is beautiful however EVWRY SINGLE TIME. I hold cup drink it would leak around the magnetic lid and around the lid base. I reached out to customer service and their response was that the product is “not leak proof”. I am returning it and getting something else,negative,mug
"I've heard so many people rave about the Yeti products and how long they maintain the cold and hot beverages.  I was extremely disappointed with the lid.  When I first got my shipment I filled the cup with water and turned it upside down and yes the lid did hold.  It did not come loose.  However, the next day I filled it with coffee and I did get some leakage from the sipping area.  It seems that part of the lid isn't still proof.  I may just got back to using my Bubba.I gave it one star because the point of a travel mug is to take with you without spilling.",negative,mug
"I’m writing because I was given this lovely red tumbler as a gift when I lost my all time favorite Starbucks tumbler that I’d had for six years.  I was thrilled with the thoughtful gift, but I didn’t think it was keeping my drinks quite as cold as my other tumbler, but I couldn’t prove it.  However, this week I accidentally discovered I am probably correct.  My spouse had just purchased a Thermos brand tumbler and had it in the car about three hours before I got into the car with my newly filled Yeti holding ice water.  We ran errands, leaving our drinks in the summer hot car between locations.  When we returned home, both tumblers were about half full, but the Thermos brand still had ice cubes in it while mine did not... and the Thermos tumbler had been filled with ice and tea hours earlier.  I am very disappointed and do not think it should be this way.  $30.00 for a tumbler is expensive; it should be even better than the less expensive Thermos brand!Sent from my iPhone",negative,mug
This is not a mag slider yeti as advertised. Just has an opening. If you want slider like I ordered this isn’t it.,negative,mug
"No me agrado que no conserva lo caliente por eso ise esa compra.Se supone que para eso es el vaso para conservar lo caliente y no me sirvió.Yo quiero regresarlo porque como es buena marca y pague $37 dólares no es justo que pierda ese dinero. El problema que confíe en el producto y tire la bolsa y los stickers. Y ahora no se como regresarlo. Si me pueden ayudar con eso por favor, gracias…",negative,mug
I don't care if it doesn't say leak proof... a mug of hot coffee should not be dripping down the side of your mouth while drinking it!!! I am shocked and don't understand the hype about this product,negative,mug
"It’s clearly been used. It’s missing part of the lid, scratched everywhere and it is dirty. It has a very large scratch on the side I was unable to photograph. I am very disappointed",negative,mug
"I only purchased Yeti because I was under the impression that the quality is 2nd to none. I couldn't have been more wrong. My first time using this , I put my hot coffee into my bag as I go to work. I closed it i sealed it etc. Next thing I know my bag is leaking coffee. My computer and my work document are soaked. My suit is soaked. All because I thought this cup wouldn't leak everywhere. I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated. I try to get a refund and they want me to ship it back and deal with that hassle. Looks like its back to hydroflask for me.",negative,mug
"Such a pitty Amazon took over YETI handling and shipping!  Yeti used to send tumblers in specially designed 6-pack cardboard boxes, where every piece is perfectly protected. Amazon just tosses the tumblers in a big box, where 40% of the space is tumblers, 20% bubbles and 40% empty space where the tumblers are free to fly all over during shipping, hitting each other, having dents, scratches in their paint. Great perfectly made products, damaged by the new handler.",negative,mug
Not sure this is a genuine Yeti product but if so very disappointing.  A leaking cup is basically worthless.  this cup leaks,negative,mug
"Please consider other products if you are seeking a ""leak"" proof product....this cup leaks and is not anywhere near spill proof and/or leak proof...I read the comments and I looked at the number of people who liked it....I have found that the reviews with one and two stars are sometimes the most reliable views to be taken to heart. I failed to adhere to them and now I am back to shopping for another cup and sending this one back. Yeti is way overrated in my opinion and they are very expensive. So I may buy another cup, one that might leak just as bad, but at least I will not have spent nearly as much money.",negative,mug
Lid arrived with no magnetic piece to cover the hole.  Will have to purchase another lid.,negative,mug
"This product leaks badly , and is big to hold if you have small hands.  Did not keep coffee hot either - I returned the product.  THis is what they told me about that product, that is clearly not indicated anywhere in the description : The MagSlider Lid is not leak-proof, but is splash resistant. The YETI Rambler tumbler is designed for a press fit lid interface and cannot be leak-proof. The YETI Rambler bottles, with their threaded interface, are the leak-proof solution. Check out the new YETI Rambler 12 oz Bottle with Hot Shot Cap for the best to offer in leak-proof heat retention.You may notice that our MagSlider Lid resists spills and splashes with cold drinks better than hot beverages. This has to do with water viscosity as cold liquids have a higher viscosity than hot liquids. Cold drinks do not move or flow as fast.Hope this helps the next person when looking for a new mug!",negative,mug
"I received my Yeti 20oz with Mugslider lid. Looks great, well built. But after a hour or two, coffee is cold. While driving, the coffee will leak past the lid, and proceed to drip, all over your cars interior. I was hoping for something better. I also liked the information pamphlet that can with the cup talking about liquid viscosity, and how cold liquid is thicker, than hot, so hot liquid will have a tendency to leak around our Mugslider lids. Here's and idea, how about making a lid that doesn't leak when you put hot liquid in a cup???I digress, TLDR don't buy if you want to use it for hot liquid i.e. coffee.",negative,mug
"Poor design. I bought this after getting a recommendation from a friend. I figured with a $30 price tag and great reviews that I would be happy with my purchase. It only took one use to convince me that this was a bad purchase.I put hot coffee into my 20oz yeti to take to work (not full, only about 15oz). On my way out of the door I noticed that, if I sightly topped the cup when the top was on tight and the sip spout closed, the coffee would bubble out of the spout. I expected that the cup would at least keep my drink inside while closed completely. I thought that maybe I hadn’t closed it all the way and tried again, but it was closed. Poor design for hot drinks. Maybe it’s better for cold drinks.I’ve already used it now, so I probably can’t return it to Amazon.",negative,mug
"It is useless as is. You need to handle cost of return shipping, replacement snd cost of re-shipping one not broken. Thanks.",negative,mug
"I'm not sure how they call this ""leak proof"". It certainly is not. The top leaks. I ordered 2 and initially returned 1 because it leaked from the opening where you drink from. Yes, I closed it all the way and IT STILL LEAKS. I got a new one and it leaks also. So now I retuning both.  If you are toting this anywhere, like I do in my lunch carrier, don't tilt it at all or you will have a puddle of coffee. NEXT!",negative,mug
"I am greatly disappointed in this tumbler as it holds at most 15 ounces if you want to use the lid, which is the only way to keep a beverage hot or cold. It barely hold 18 ounces without the lid without spilling over. I will no longer waste my money on Yeti products, especially since after contacting the company & telling them I did an actual measured pour in it & they still insist it holds 20 ounces but “you may not be able to use the lid with that much in it”. False advertising.",negative,mug
"Sure, the coffee mug looks good and I really wanted it to work but its a no go for me. This thing leaks from 2 points of the mag slider. My coffee stayed warm for about 2 hours and I think thats being generous. Maybe if you are staying home and drinking your coffee under 2 hours this mug is perfect for you. I tried bringing it to work this morning and I usually carry my portable coffee mugs in the side pocket of my back pack. I set it down in my car and it spilled all over my seat. At work I refilled it and was driving around in my work truck watching this thing leak through the lid. Two hours had gone by and my coffee was almost room temp. Weak! I just printed up a return slip to send back",negative,mug
This was a Christmas gift to someone and the MAGNET LID is freaking missing.,negative,mug
"First, let me start by saying that I was a huge Yeti fan. I have owned three other 20 ounce tumblers prior to her ordering this one. The lid on this cup leaked badly, so I returned it and ordered another one. The replacement leaked even worse. Very frustrated, will not be buying another Yeti mug again.  Very disappointed at the lack of quality at this price point.",negative,mug
"This is not the product for you if you define travel coffee tumbler the way I do: place in the side pocket of my back pack, in the console of my car, with no worries of leaking. This Yeti lid, though easy to clean, leaks onto the surface of the lid when closed up tight. The lid also pops off easily, and I'm not happy with the spillage results from that. Lastly, it is so-so on keeping the coffee warm.",negative,mug
If it falls over it leaks.  Awful thermos.  Don't buy!,negative,mug
"I purchased this Yeti after trying out one just like this given to my husband by a vendor at work. I was so amazed by the fact that his keeps water so cold even a day later. Thinking this would encourage me to drink more water, I purchased one like his.Though it seems like I received the correct product, this certainly doesn't keep my water cold. It's just like any old cup. Of course I threw away the packaging immediately, so I'm stuck with an overpriced cup. I haven't tried coffee in it because if it doesn't keep cold drinks cold, I can't imagine it would keep hot drinks hot.If I try Yeti again, I certainly will not purchase through Amazon, and I will definitely test out the cup before discarding the packaging.",negative,mug
This product leaks a lot!  I thought I was getting a premium product by buying  YETI.  NOT AT ALL.  It didn't keep drinks Hot for long either.  I am sending it back.Could NOT recommend this Yetti product -- or any other Yeti product based on this experience.I had a Contigo insulated tumbler that I had for 20 years.  It worked extremely well -- COULD NOT RECOMMENDhot things stayed very hot for many hours and it NEVER LEAKED.  Found it again on Amazon and ordered two.  The price was very good -- especially compared to the Yeti!  I KNOW the CONTIGO WORKS!,negative,mug
It doesn’t keep coffee warm and is not leakproof.,negative,mug
Below average performance. Not worth it at all.,negative,mug
"When Yeti says “ the only drink lid that uses the power of magnets to keep your water, beer, or favorite drink on lock”, I took that term ‘lock’ to mean it wouldn’t leak. Silly me. Leaks like a screen door. For $30 bucks I expected this to be something I could grab heading out the door, throw in the truck cup holder and go. I tried this and had to go back inside to get paper towels to wipe coffee off my jacket and iPad.I saw a couple of aftermarket lids. Does anyone know if any of these seal properly?",negative,mug
"This cup has never kept my coffee hot since day 1. My old mug that I've had for years does a much better job at keeping thing hot or cold. After measuring the outside temp of the cup at 70 degrees I  placed boiling water in the cup, the temp rose to 103 degrees in a mater or minutes. Heat is not being retained. I filled out the warranty form with Yeti but I have not heard back.",negative,mug
"This is the WORST travel mug I've ever used.  I guess it's ok if you don't actually travel with it.  The lid is the problem.  They don't come out and say in the description that it's ""leak proof"".  You have to go to the manufacturer web site and watch a video to learn that.  It's not even ""splash proof"".  The liquid inside easily comes out just with normal motion of carrying it.Also, when you drink from it, some liquid pools up in front of the hole, so if you snap the closure shut after drink it it can splash up.  I got some on my glasses while driving, which was NOT COOL.Stay away from this mug!!!",negative,mug
I have purchased Yeti mugs from Dick's Sporting Goods in the past and they work great so I am familiar with Yeti's product. I ordered one of these cups and liked the color so ordered another one for a family member. We only use these cups for cold beverages. The cups worked fine for few weeks but then the outside of the cup began to feel cold after filling it with ice and beverage and it stopped keeping ice for more than 3-4 hours. I don't believe these are brand Yeti. I wish I had trialed the first one before buying the second one.,negative,mug
"Received the Yeti Rambler 20 oz tumbler. I loved the color sea foam green. It is a graduation gift which I'm giving today, 5-7-21. I was placing the cup in the gift bag & noticed the leakproof lid looked odd, there was no magnet on the lid to close over the opening. I bought the cup & handle, pd over $40.00 total & now I have to pay $10.00 for the replacement magnet. I just now got it out of the box it was shipped in & the magnet is not in the box. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",negative,mug
I received the yeti and it looks great but it is missing the magnetic piece for the lid.7/18.Still no response and this was for a gift. I had to order a 3 pack of the magnetic piece. Since I took one off of a brand new yeti I also bought for myself.,negative,mug
I love Yeti cups and bought a 20oz on 9/21 and absolutely loved it! not even a year later my cup is starting to taste like tin or aluminum.  I am extremely disappointed due to the brand name Yeti and the cost of the cups,negative,mug
Decent at being lean proof and it does a good job as far as keeping my drink cold.... my only complaint and I feel like it’s a big one is that this is sold as a 20oz rambler yet it only holds 15oz.  If that isn’t false advertisement then I don’t know what is.  Annoying pouring a drink in it and having to drink 5oz that are left from a 20oz drink...... if I had known these ran small then I would have bought a bigger one.... or maybe they could sell the product that they advertise????,negative,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I just received this Yeti yesterday. The lid is not leak-proof. There seems to be a hole in the underside of the lid. I uploaded a video. It appears to be a factory defect, or a mistake in the ways they plug the two holes on either side of the slide lid. I'll be returning this thing. I was hoping that spending so much money on one rambler would guarantee that I would get something of great quality. I really needed the lid to be leak-proof because this rambler is going into my fiance's lunch bag & it won't be set upright.",negative,mug
"If for some reason you pour your coffee in this tumbler, walk to your kitchen table and sit there the entire time to drink your coffee, it's great! But if you take this in your car to get or work or anywhere else, it leaks so bad. It leaks through the top part of the lid that you slide open and closed. I had ""high hopes"" for buying the Yeti brand and I literally got burned (by my coffee that poured out of the closed lid). It's not a small leak either, the liquid comes though at ease and literally gets everywhere. I know Yeti seems like the cool legit brand here, but do not buy this. It's cheap very poorly made.",negative,mug
Who would pack a cup without a lid? I should’ve paid attention the reviews.,negative,mug
Well the cup was broken and had no sliding closure on the lid. But it did come a day late. However there is good news at some point I may get a new one… maybe,negative,mug
"OK I’m really sad about this. Heard of the brand, I have the chairs, read the reviews, said it would keep your drink hot or cold. I want it for hot coffee. Made me a cuppa coffee put it in this thing within minutes it was cool not hot. Stuck it in the microwave, it appeared to be a microwave safe. Took it out no change in the temperature. I’ll try to three times and it more cold my coffee than it originally was so I returned it. I have several cold Type cups that work well. I just wanted something that will keep my coffee really hot in this did not do it in anyway shape or form",negative,mug
"I would have liked the tumbler if it was as advertised as a 20 oz, but it was a 16 oz. Measured with liquide.",negative,mug
I ordered one of these as I've been using a Tal bottle from walmart ($11) ... thinking this Yeti would be great and that it would keep my coffee hot not spill etc well all of the hype over these are false. My coffee is cold within minutes!!! It leaks and it's not so easy to hold unless you spend another $10 for the handle after spending $39  for the tumbler.  Pfft my Walmart tal works way more amazing. I can put hot coffee in it at 7am and it still hot at 7pm.  Don't believe me buy one. I will be returning my yeti and purchasing another tal from Walmart,negative,mug
I ordered this item as a gift and it was missing the magnet lid. Amazon won’t send a replacement so I have to buy the magnet lid separately now even though in the description it says it’s included. Without the magnet lid this item is basically a waste of money. I added a picture so you can see without the magnet lid you cannot close the tumbler.,negative,mug
"I used this once for coffee, very excited to have an insulated tumbler again after I had lost a cheap Contigo, it doesn't hold at all. Coffee bouncing around in it results in coffee spilled all over my backpack...",negative,mug
So disappointed! My coffee is spilling from the lid!!,negative,mug
"CHINA not USA... I have been looking for a thermal cup for some time now.  Looking at all the information provided by the maker, I was under the impression that this product was made in the USA.  Unfortunately, after unpacking and reading the bottom of the tumbler,  it states designed in Texas, MADE IN CHINA!I would not have made the purchase if I known that it was made in CHINA.",negative,mug
,negative,mug
I heard a lot of good things about YETI.  I usually don't pay a lot for a travel mug. But I purchased this one. Carrying the mug and my thermos while locking my door and the mug starts to leak at the magnetic slide. I had a travel mug that I paid a third of the price and it lasted over a year until the o ring went.,negative,mug
"The cup it self is good quality. It keeps my coffee warm for hours, as long as I leave it some where safe. I would love to know how you can label something a tumbler but as soon as it tumbles you better have some rags to clean up the mess it made.🤯🤯 I like how you can buy a handle for it but then again you already spent a boat load on the orginal cup now you need to but accessories. Wow such a scam just for a brand that really has only been around sense 2006. Look somewhere else for a coffee cup and save yourself some money.",negative,mug
The shipping took much longer than stated when I placed the order. Then the lid didn’t have the closet on it.,negative,mug
"BWP Sales advertised this rambler as a 20 ounce capacity. However, after owning it for a couple months I decided to check the volume. Imagine my surprise when this rambler only holds 16 ounces!  I am very unhappy because the seller's only response is that I cannot return this item since it is outside the return window. This vendor is falsely advertising this product. BEWARE if you buy any Yeti products from BWP Sales. I also ordered another cup and it came damaged but I returned it immediately.",negative,mug
I’m sure the tumbler would of been great if it didn’t come scratched up and where I live there is know where close to return this cup so looks like I’m out the money and can’t give it as a Mother’s Day gift which is what is was purchased for :(,negative,mug
"I love the Yeti brand and own several. They are always my go-to for gifts, which is why I was super disappointed that this arrived damaged. At first I thought it was maybe just paint or something and I could scrub it off, but this was AFTER using a couple different cleaning products. The bottom is all scratched up too. I still love the brand, but the quality control needs to be better, especially for the price.",negative,mug
"Not impressed at all! I've owned Yeti products for years, never have I've been so disappointed with a purchase! Both Rambler's I received a week ago already have fading spot's all over. They look absolutely hideous. The slider lids simply don't work. Even while completely closed, the lids release liquid. Either these Rambler's are poor quality knock-offs or Yeti has lowered their quality control standards and have begun to use cheaper processes during production. Even though this Amazon, I probably won't get a refund. The packaging was thrown away immediately after getting both of them. So, would I ever own another Yeti? Not very likely after this experience.",negative,mug
I got this for my dad.  He has a large Yeti that keeps things cold but he wanted a smaller cup for hot drinks.  I got him the 20 oz. Stainless and splurged on the magnetic lid.  Coffee was luke warm in 30 min.  I called Yeti customer service.  They reviewed the purchase & photos I they asked me to send.  They approved the return and told me the options for getting it back to them. But when I called back to get the return authorization they changed their mind and denied the return until I performed heating/cooling tests before they'd authorize it (even though they had already authorized it).,negative,mug
"So disappointed with this product. It leaks so bad! If it topples over, you'll be sure to have a big mess, even if the sliding lid is closed. I thought at first I didn't seal the lid tightly, but no... I experimented to see if it happens again and it LEAKS SO BAD!!! What's the use of having a lid/cover if it can't keep the liquid in?! This is one of the MOST AWFUL coffee tumblers I have ever had. So DISAPPOINTED with Yeti. This is not a quality product! I will never purchase another Yeti product again.BUY THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!",negative,mug
"Total garbage and not worth the money unless you can keep the lid completely parallel to the ground. I made my coffee, put it in my bag, walk for blocks and by the time i got on the bus I could smell my coffee.  Not necessarily the results that Yenti pitches or justifies a $30 price tag. I am so glad I chose to put it in a plastic bag lined with paper towels before putting it in my bag or everything would have been covered in coffee. The top where you drink from was leaking like crazy. What a joke this thing is. Trust me, buy an Otterbox. At least they don't leak.",negative,mug
"A full 20 oz cup of scalding hot coffee cooled to lukewarm in 2.5 hours sitting unopened on a table inside a warm room.  Lid leaks profusely when closed. Hot coffee doesn’t drip or slowly leak, it literally gushes out the closed lid in a 2” long stream...through a CLOSED LID.  Unlike Yeti’s enclosed explanation of liquid viscosity suggesting hot fluids are more likely to leak than cold fluids, having a 2” long stream of hot coffee gushing out of a closed lid does not even happen in my much less expensive Target brand Chinese thermal cups.",negative,mug
Arrived a day later and without the magslider attachment for the lid! Without that it can’t be sealed and is basically useless. Another black one isn’t arrive for days. Seriously disappointed and won’t repurchase.,negative,mug
It leaks when you are not holding straight and this is annoying !,negative,mug
"This is absolutely a fake YETI - do not buy if you're looking for the real thing! I took it into the official YETI store when it showed odd color changes after the first time through the dishwasher. They identified it as a fake and held it up next to the real thing as a comparison (see photos - green is the fake). Even worse, the real ones are cheaper at $29.99. This may be a fine thermos, but it is NOT a YETI. If you're looking for the real thing, order directly through YETI.",negative,mug
Thought I would get one with magnetic black lid ! But why it has no and looks like that?,negative,mug
"Pretty pointless without the magnetic clasp, not really sure how they managed to screw this up. Gave me the option to exchange for silver, but I obviously purchased the color I wanted so I’m not compromising on something that wasn’t my error to begin with",negative,mug
"I’m giving this one star because it doesn’t do what any basic coffee thermos should do: not leak. Held upright, with the lid on and the mag slider closed, my coffee consistently splashes up and leaks out the top through the mag slider. There is no way I could travel with this thermos without it leaking — even just walking or having it stashed upright in the side pocket of a backpack. I’ve seen other reviewers with this issue, so I do t know if it is a batch defect or what.It does keep my coffee warm and it’s easy to clean. So there’s that!",negative,mug
I ordered one and it came without the mouth piece so I thought maybe it was missing so I returned it and had them send me another and that one came in the same way.....my problem with it is that they show the picture with the mouth piece attached if that's the case take that picture down and show it as it is!,negative,mug
"Leaked and decided to go back to a cups I can buy at Target.I had really hoped that I would have a good experience because the packaging, size, and all of the features it was supposed to have really attracted me.At the end of the day though it would leak when I used it to drink out of.For the price I'm not going to Monkey around I just returned it and headed off to Target. The cups I buy at Target aren't as cute but they don't leak on me.",negative,mug
"I've never purchased a Yeti before so I can't say for sure if this was a knockoff, however I can say Yeti or not, I'm completely disappointed with the lid. This claims to be ""spillproof"", which it's clearly not. I filled it with boiling water and put the lid on it (I use it to warm my son's bottle when we're on the road), stuck it in the diaper bag thinking it was spillproof. When I put the diaper bag over my shoulder and leaned over to pick something up, the water leaked out of the lid and burned my backside, causing a blister.",negative,mug
I have several yeti tumblers.I purchased a 20 ounce rambler for a friend in Tahoe blue.  Prong horn outfitters dropped the ball they put 30 ounce Tumblr's in a plastic bag with a UPC label that says 20 ounce.  That was the correct color but the wrong size the 30 ounce is nowhere near the same size or same shape so whoever is packing the boxes is not paying attention to their job details! I can't even re-order right now  to try to get the right item because I'll end up with a 30 ounce  instead of a 20 ounce.,negative,mug
I bought a pink yeti alas a gift for a frienf and received a white one. The bimni pink was way more expensive.,negative,mug
"Arrive without the lid and the magnet.Also, have a defective.",negative,mug
I just bought this tumbler for work. During my first time use it leaked and coffee was everywhere on my clothes and bag. Honestly very disappointed.,negative,mug
This product was recommended to me however it is not what I expected. I purchased this for my hot coffee yet it has never been coffee once I made it to work in 20 minutes. The price of it isn’t worth the usage of hot beverages. I wish I sent it back.I will continue to use look for a different brand that is more reliable in keeping hot drinks hot.,negative,mug
"I've already used it so I can't send it back, but a $10mug from the dollar store would hold ice longer. Ice starts melting within an hour, and coffee starts getting Luke warm within an hour. My daughter-n-law says I must of gotten ripped off bc all of her yettis will keep ice all day and will still havesome ice in it the next day.",negative,mug
"I bought this for my husband. He said it Did not keep his coffee hot for hours. By the 3rd hour it was only luke warm. I'm not sure if I received a fluke commuter mug or if this is standard for a Yeti Rambler. In any case, it is too pricey for only a couple of hours of keeping coffee hot. I am returning it and buying him a Contigo like mine for a lot less.",negative,mug
"FALSE ADVERTISING1) Not stainless steel it's actually aluminum.2) Stainless steel doesn't stain or rust.3) Yeti is made of ALUMINUM which stains and rusts.4) Yeti's warranty doesn't cover rust.  See their website where it states rust isn't covered under their warranty and  suggests a solution to their rusting products is to use Barkeepers Friend to clean out the rust.5) STOP selling your products advertising  ""Stainless Steel"" as a way to charge outrageous prices.",negative,mug
"Bought this thing after avoiding this brand for so long. Just always felt it was overpriced. Welp I gave in because I was tired of my $10-15 Walmart cups that fall apart, but they don’t leak….. This thing I was pumped because I figured this would be “you get what you pay for” nope, this thing leaks any chance it get gets a lil tip…",negative,mug
It started ok then after 3 uses it leaked all over.I regret this purchase and the return window closed.,negative,mug
"This pic is my first use, not kidding. It looks 10 years old? What's with the scratches. Also, I ordered navy color. Getting so sick of Amazon.",negative,mug
"I just bought this today and I liked it up until I dropped it, while walking through my kitchen. The lid shattered and my drink spilled everywhere. I then (finally) read the reviews and found out this may be a counterfeit product, and not the original. I really hope that this is the case because I was a proud owner of a YETI for like 6 hours. . .Not as described, not happy.",negative,mug
First and foremost is that it leaks!!!!! This thing Is expensive! And it leaks. Second…it doesn’t fit under my keurhig coffee maker. And third…you have to hold it with your right hand and I’m left handed. I actually ordered two different styles of Yeti and they both leaked I was disgusted. I went back to my 12 oz Starbucks cup that never leaks but is smaller than I wanted.,negative,mug
"I'm extremely disappointed in this first Yeti purchase. I live in the outdoors, on a farm, and my first trip with my new Yeti tumbler resulted in hot tea splashing out of the top of the cup through the closed lid and onto my truck. If you are just sitting at a desk and want your drink to stay hot for a while, this will work. If you are active and expect this expensive mug to keep the liquid in, not for you.",negative,mug
"Bought this rambler after knowing a bit about the yeti brand and the good things which came along. However this is only my 3rd time using this cup with the magslider lid, and I must say I'm very disappointed. The lid leaks, well doesn't leak, but POURS out the contents in the cup. Ruined the papers which were near it, my books, and everything and it wasn't even tipped over completely! It was literally leaning out of a pocket in my backpack and the backpack was sitting straight on the floor. THE LID IS NOT LEAK OR SPILL PROOF, DO NOT BUY THIS CUP WITH THIS LID. Instead I recommend tacamo, they are spill and leak proof.",negative,mug
"Compré este artículo pensando que el café se mantendría caliente por, al menos, unas 4 horas pero a la hora ya está frío. Decepcionante. No volvería a comprar uno, es mejor la marca THERMOS.",negative,mug
I bought 4 of these. Yea 4 of them. To have different beverages in them while I’m on the road. I used for Protein Shakes as well. After the second use I noticed a terrible smell when I open the lid. I ran it through the dishwasher atleast 10 times and the smell wouldn’t go. Hand washed it’s still there. I soaked overnight with hot water and it just wouldn’t go. I’m really disappointed and wouldn’t recommend for drinks other than water and coffee.,negative,mug
"Receive this cup Aug12, sending it back Aug 17th. It has the name Yeti in it but it doesn't do what a genuine Yeti does. I have a Yeti cup that I have had for years but I just wanted another one, now I'm going back to my old one. What about this cup I don't like, it doesn't keep my ice, I expect some melting but before my 8-hour shift is over my ice is melted and my drink is watery. In a genuine Yeti cup, this does not happen.",negative,mug
Leaks,negative,mug
Counterfeit piece of junk!  The rambler pictured shows the magnetic slider lid.  The rambler I received shipped from China and came with a cheap piece of plastic lid with no magnetic closure.  I do not believe the tumbler is even vacuum sealed as hot coffee turns cold in a matter of minutes.  It is deplorable that Amazon allows counterfeit sales like this.,negative,mug
1 star as lid was missing MagSlider. I was hoping product support will come through and send missing part but that didn't happen. I will return it.,negative,mug
"It being of the acclaimed “yeti” brand, this tumbler was terrible. Sure aestetics, the feel are nice, it’s yeti, but what it is actually suppose to do like keep the drink inside of the tumbler, was not happening. I bought this for my wife who uses public transportation to commute to work. She needed something reliable, durable. What good is the product of it cannot even stay inside of the tumbler ? It was spilling all over very easily. Again, it doesn’t do what it’s suppose to, keep the drink inside without it Spilling. Big thumbs down",negative,mug
Yetti is a name. Ice melted fast. I have a Dutch brothers that holds ice a long time. Yetti quality is going down hill. You’re paying for a name.,negative,mug
Hi I bought this for my mom and to my disappointment it already started leaking from the lid and she barely even used it. Now I'm outside the return window and can't get a replacement. Very disappointed.,negative,mug
the cup is know for having the MagSlider lid to protect water from spilling but they forgot put the piece on the tumbler but then i though maybe it is in the box but no they completely forgot the piece in general.,negative,mug

"Performance is goodDesign is goodBut so are the others…Is this one better though? Well since they are the same thing, obviously one does not perform better than the other.There’s no technology here. Just a double walled cup.Product gets an F though because of Value vs competitors.",negative,mug
"Large amounts of mold will build up where the silicone ring is on the lid. I have this since November 2020 and just realized this after seeing black flakes in my water. The silicone ring itself is extremely hard to clean all the mold off due the the small crevices, also a huge inconvenience to get that detailed in the cleaning daily, going back to my Nalgene Bottle for now!",negative,mug
I love Yeti products but I think that Amazon‘a survey contractor is terrible. Asking a customer to review a product before it has been delivered is pathetic.,negative,mug
Ordered 2. Both in same box. One was clearly new. In plastic bag with yeti papers. The other was thrown in as is. No plastic. No papers. No magnetic slide top. Luckily I Ordered more magnetic top peices too,negative,mug
Cup is trash! Yeti wants to make a pretty cup with a magnetic lid and the Glorius YETI name but forgets about the most important part of an insulated coffee cup... IT NEEDS TO NOT LEAK!!!! if the cups leaking air is getting in and therefore rendering the stupid cup useless and for 30$ SHAME ON YOU! I I don't give a fck how hot it keeps my coffee if it isn't leakproof its absolutely useless......you need to seriously go back and add some type of gasket or seal when the magnetic flip is closed,negative,mug
The product did not live up to my hype as it came already with dried coffee and hair. Thank you,negative,mug
"Cup itself is fine, however did not come with the magslider as described in the product description, an additional$20 this cost me. Disappointed to see a lie this bold. Do yourself a favor and buy this item at a store.  The internet is going to hell, too many thieves are out there. It is time to support local retailers again.",negative,mug
"I have been using this cup for hot and cold, doesn’t do either! Very disappointed. Not sure this is an authentic product. My other yeti mugs keep ice cold overnight, did a side-by-side comparison. This one just does not cut it.",negative,mug
"THIS IS NOT A YETI!  It LOOKED great- but wait and use it a few times.... Errr.... I am returning this. I have issued for a return. I do not have original packaging because this was a Christmas gift. My son used it 3-4 times. IT RUSTED on the inside!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! He works outdoors in extreme cold. Not sure why it rusted. A YETI WOULD NOT RUST! According to merchant return policy they will ONLY refund if in original packaging and new/unused condition. WELL... This had better get refunded. Scammers. We will see,",negative,mug
The magnetic lid fails to seal liquids. Retarded design.,negative,mug
The black cup is a real Yeti. The King Crab color was bought on Amazon in which I believed to be a real Yeti.,negative,mug
"I've had this tumbler for a while, I never really liked it. It worked ok, but I thought that it just wasn't living up to the hype. Come to realize, it's not a real yeti tumbler. On the bottom, it says ""patorpending visit yeti.com/patorpending."" PAT OR PENDING. I'm laughing out loud. Anyways, don't waist your money!",negative,mug
"I received this package without any outer packaging, it was delivered in a bag, it has been scratched all around, and the lid on the cup has not been received, I cannot use this product",negative,mug
"Not happy with it’s insulating capabilities.  The Contigo travel mug I bought at Target works better!!  Bad lid design. Not worth 30 bucks for sure. And I bought 7 of these as gifts for all my adult kids because everyone raves about what a great product YETI is.  YETI should redesign the lid, and then offer a free replacement to everyone who bought this particular mug.",negative,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Got this beautiful cup for Father's day, was very excited about my first Yeti cup, very disappointing to see it leak all over my bag. My much cheaper cup don't leak. Will replace it Hopefully it was just 1 bad apple. 🤞",negative,mug
"I don’t understand all the hype about this travel mug! It leaks like crazy! If you are a city commuter this is NOT the mug for you. Mine leaks so much that I actually contacted Yeti because I was convinced I received a defective one. But nope, they told me the magnaslider lid leaks to allow for ventilation. I’ve had plenty of coffee mugs that keep the coffee just as hot for just as long while being leakproof, so that response is a joke. Going back to my tried and true Thermos brand.",negative,mug
"I never thought I would give a bad review of this product, I have been using it for years and this one I bought, came with defects ... The liquid is thrown out of the lid.Disappointed because it was a gift to my boyfriend and it came damaged",negative,mug
It leaks and spills all the time. spilled on my uniform and lunch pail a lot of times. It was my first purchase and I'm really disappointed. I asked the customer service to give me new lid but they did not. Paid too expensive for this cup and it was to worth it. Poor warranty too .,negative,mug
MAKE SURE YOUR LID COMES WITH MAGNETIC CLOSURE. I bought this and didn’t notice until a month later when I went to wrap it that the cup lid did NOT come with the magnetic closure but that you put on top to open and close where the liquid comes out of. I will be returning this item and going to Lowe’s to buy a Yeti rambler that actually comes with everything it’s supposed to have.,negative,mug
The cup came with a heavy perfume/air freshener scent. I am not sure why a drinkable item came smelling like that.,negative,mug
for some reason the lid opening did not have an opening.  usually yeti products are perfect to drink out of when the lid is on.  returned immediately,negative,mug
My lid was broken and the black slider on top of the lid was broke off. Not very happy with it,negative,mug
"Finally splurged and got a Yeti but think I got a dud-does not keep drinks cold very long. Ice melts pretty fast, so disappointed.",negative,mug
This Yeti broke after only one use.  The black part on the lid broke the very first time my husband used,negative,mug
"The Rambler arrives damaged, it had a dent in it. Not happy but impossible to return as the process goes round and round in circles! Very disappointed in all.",negative,mug
"12 brand new $35 cups thrown in a box. I’ll be returning them and since it’s a STANDARD YEAR ROUND COLOR, I’ll keep returning them until they get me 12 undamaged cups.",negative,mug
"Love the cup, but missing the magslider",negative,mug
Not much to appreciate here. The entire purpose of a travel mug is to contain liquids without spilling. One slight shake and coffee begins pooling in the top of the cap with the sliding cap closed. Poorly designed and a waste of money due to this.,negative,mug
I was excited to purchase more Yeti products having enjoyed a tumbler gifted to me. The ones I purchased via Amazon are not even close to the original / official. Beverages do not stay particularly hot or cold after even an hour. I purchased the Tumbler and Mug. Truly bummed bc I am a huge fan of the other one I have.,negative,mug
This is not my first yeti product and I have loved everything from them. Buy this tumbler gets 1 star from me! Within the first month of use I noticed my water tasted bad.  I saw small spots of RUST on the bottom of mug! Now I'm trying to figure out if I can still return.,negative,mug
This is misleading. When I order a 20 oz product it is because I want to drink 20 oz. It's impossible to fit 20 oz in this with the lid. This should be labeled 16 oz or 18 oz. Very disappointed.,negative,mug
"This is horrible.  You have to press a button so hard to release coffee.  I can't press and drink at the same time, because button is so stiff.  Most horrible design I ever saw.",negative,mug
"These are JUNK I wanted them because in their advertisement they state that the mugs are good for keeping drinks hot for five (5) hours - WRONG the most time that I was able to get hot was almost an hour. It only gets worse from there. Cold for twelve (12) hours - NOT TRUE you will get a cold drink for about 90 minutes then you'll get luke warm. When I read that it keeps liquid hot for five (5) hours I made the mistake of buying three(3). Thinking it may have only been the one, I tried the other two no luck. I even tried to pre heat them - that was only a waste of time. These Are JUNK don't waste your time or money.",negative,mug
Did coffee did not stay hot more than 2 hours,negative,mug
"Although the inside stays hot and the outside cool, and it doesn't leak when tilted, I find this mug very hard to drink out of. You have to tilt it way back, even when it is full, to get a sip. Having to keep the button pressed continuously while drinking is a pain. But my main complaint is that tea is dripping down the side. I'm not saying that the mug is necessarily leaking, but as I drink the hot tea, perhaps some drops get past my lips ... it is quite hard to drink out of. So a bit of tea drips into the button, since the button is right below where you drink from, and then down the side of the mug. I am constantly wiping tea from the outside, which is also a pain. I am very unhappy with this product, and I'm very sad that I wasted $17 on it. I think it will cost too much shipping to make it worth sending back.",negative,mug
"I bought this product with the hope of having hot coffee for hours.  Unfortunately, like so many of these products with silly directions you break the tab before you can even put one drop of coffee in this thing!  The instructions simply say ""Flip the tab"" top of the mug - it does not say how you can accomplish this with minimal force.  Of course, I forced it, broke it off, tried to replace it with a hammer, never to ""flip"" again!  It's supposed to be important to do this because this releases pressure before you drink the coffee!  I don't know why these products have to be so HARD to deal with - I feel they are senior-unfriendly all the way!",negative,mug
"Ok so I purchased this travel mug because I wanted to start making coffee from home instead of buying coffee at work everyday.I also  wanted something to keep my coffee hot for a prolonged period of time. I was so excited to receive my order, the mug itself is beautiful and well made. My issue is that after the first time using it, it no longer keeps my coffee hot . The first time I used it I made coffe at 10am went to work at 4 and my coffee was still hot when I get there. Now I make coffee at 2:50 pm get to work at 4 and it’s not even warm. I don’t know if mine is defective or what but I’m very disappointed.",negative,mug
I've owned MANY Contigo cups and this one is the first that POURS OUT without holding the release button which is the MAIN REASON I buy Contigo!,negative,mug
"I have bought many Contigo products in the past and have generally been pleased with them, but  I seem to have received a defective item.  In the beginning, it worked fine but a few months after , the outside of the mug is extremely hot when I put hot water in it , then after an hour or so, the liquid inside gets cold. It is as if the heat that is supposed to be on the inside, transfers to the outside.I have never had this issue before and it is quite baffling.",negative,mug
"So disappointed. I love Contigo cups, and was so excited to get one in my favorite color... but this particular ""leakproof"" cup leaks terribly. I didn't think to test it, because I have others that are true to the claim, and have never leaked.... but when I threw this one in my tote to take to work, all of my papers were covered in coffee when I got there. Of course. I just got on here to see if I could return it, and just missed the return window.",negative,mug
"Surprised this is 2013 version. Was misled by high reviews. Used to be happier with a 2015 Contigo. This is (Almost) impossible to drink hot coffee with due to weak flow control even using a paper cup to pour the hot drink isn't working nicely as many drops get out of the way to my shirt, car seat or office desk. Never going to recommend to any friend at all.",negative,mug
I got this cup in the purple for Christmas and loved it  decided to get the teal one so I dont have to keep washing the purple one. First day using it and it doesnt keep my coffee warm. I picked it up from the coffee maker and the cup itself was super hot. I'm so disappointed because I loved the purple one.,negative,mug
Loved the color but that's all. Looks like the intricate top will be hard to keep clean and sanitary. To me it's uncomfortable to drink from and last but not lease it took forever to remove the plastic wrapping and the cup was scratched by the time I finally succeeded in removing it. Thank goodness it wasn't too expensive because it's headed for the trash.,negative,mug
"Something has changed with this company. I'm still using a mug bought at least 12 years ago. It seals, keeps coffee hot-tp=warm for several hours. The sealing mechanism has worn out, so I need to hold the button just so. SO I have bought 2 of these new ones. Neither of them are double-walled, do cool down really fast, like 10-20 minutes. I just don't trust buying one of these without being able to see and feel the thickness of the walls.",negative,mug
"The mug is a beautiful color and doesn't scratch easily. However, it only keeps coffee hot for an hour or two. I'm a teacher who has to take sips here and there through the morning and I hate tepid coffee.  Disappointing. :(",negative,mug
"Bought this new version after the old one started to smell bad. This one broke within less than 3 weeks of use while I was cleaning it. Maybe it’s easy to clean, but it’s even easier to break the mechanism while cleaning.Very disappointing.",negative,mug
"Based on this purchase Contigo changed the shape of the thermos. The rim is to big to accommodate the Melita coffee funnels I use to make my second, take along cup of coffee. It is also too large for my hand. I do not like it.",negative,mug
"I am sorry to say but this product broke within a few times of use. The latch that you push do open the seal to drink coffee no longer worked and did not open. I have owned many mugs, and never have seen one break so quickly. Even less expensive mugs have lasted a lot longer.",negative,mug
"This has the worst bitter/chemical taste! I've soaked it 3 times and still has a horrible taste. I've been reluctant to use it cuz I can't stand the taste. I know it's designed to keep your coffee hot, but it takes like 45 min before you are even able to take one sip because it keeps the coffee soooo hot!! Disappointed with this purchase",negative,mug
This coffee mug does not keep coffee even warm for a few hours. I fill it up before going to work and when I’m ready to finish drinking it 2 hours later it has already cooled off.,negative,mug
Thermal properties are as advertised.Color covering peals and can be found wherever cup is used.Afraid that it might be ingested.Do not buy with color covering.,negative,mug
Bought it few weeks ago and something already broke in the inside. Leaking and not keeping my coffee hot anymore. Help! I loved it before this happened.,negative,mug
This is definitely not leak proof. Everything leaks out of the autoseal button. I can’t even take a sip without it spilling all over me.,negative,mug
I am VERY disappointed in this product! I did not know that it is NOT dishwasher safe! After the first wash it started pealing and looks terrible. Do you really want people to see how your product performs?,negative,mug
I am very disappointed. This bottle doesn't seal right and spills on you when you try to drink. This wasn't a cheap purchase either! And my bottle came with a small dent in it.,negative,mug
"The lid broke, not as in cracked. The stopper function broke after about 12 uses allowing the coffee to pour out at all times.",negative,mug
Bought this June 25 it worked beautifully until about a month ago it no longer completely seals so I always have to beware of where I place it,negative,mug
Just brought this for my mom and she used it for a little bit and the spring broke and now it’s useless.,negative,mug

Write a letter to your State's Consumer Protection stating the product's name and why you are dissatisfied. State that you cannot get a refund from Amazon.com because Contigo will not honor their lifetime warranty. Print a copy of you Amazon receipt plus and send it with printed cell photos of your defects on you own printer machine. Repeat the process and write a letter to the BBB. I ALWAYS get my satisfaction when I take these simple steps. 100%!!! Hope my advice helps.,negative,mug
I got the product and it was dented and look like its been used before. I decided to test it out by putting water in it. To my surprise it was NOT LEAK PROOF. The water poured out so fast. It was also difficult to drink from. One pro is that it does seem to look easy to clean. You can open the mouth piece to clean even more which is great because no one wants mold. I wish it was actually leak proof and not damage. I do not understand how this product received 5 stars.,negative,mug
"I’ve been a Contigo loyalist for many years but that changed this morning. I went to pour just-made hot coffee from this travel mug into a regular mug and the hot coffee spewed out of the lock mechanism and/or the button that allows for drinking and burned me.Burn me once, shame on you; burn me twice, shame on me. You aren’t getting a second chance, Contigo. I urge everyone to find another travel mug unless you want a hot, hurtful surprise!",negative,mug
"I'm writing this review with a wet patch on my back and a backpack full of clothes soaked with Monster energy drink. It's a great bottle apart from the leaking issue. This is the second time this has happened after I've made sure the lock is on and the top was properly seated. This wouldn't be that big of an issue if they hadn't claimed it was extremely leak proof, but I bought it specifically so I could throw it in a gym bag and not worry. This is now the second time it's ruined the contents of my bag, and I will not be purchasing another Contigo product.",negative,mug

"I have a LOT of Stanley gear. Never had to write a review till now, as theyve always performed very well for me.This review is for the 20oz Trigger Action flask. I bought it, to replace a 16oz version I got in 2019 and sadly yet understandably, couldn't survive a mobile crane driving over it!! THAT flask was amazing, living up to every claim.Sadly over the past few years, Ive seen the Stanley quality slowly get worse, even down to nice badges being replaced with stickers, to now just having the emblem cheaply printed on.The 20oz does NOT work as advertised, like literally my hot drink is almost cold after 3 hours, and thats with pre heating the flask as well. The outer of my 16oz never used to get warm, ie losing heat, but the 20oz is terrible, almost being a hand warmer the outside gets so warm. This is the precious heat of my drink wasting away. Very disappointed.",negative,mug
"Not easy to clean unless you have a lot of spare time, or a dishwasher. This isn’t just a thermos bottle, it has PARTS. As in—other than a simple lid and bottle. Springs, rubber rings and components, pieces of plastic. The lid is full of holes and crevices that a human finger will never get to. I wouldn’t be annoyed if this wasn’t specifically advertised as “easy to clean.” I got it because I need something I can clean it by hand. Soap, warm water, hands, maybe a paper towel if I’m lucky. But now I get the bottle and it’s some contraption that I would have to buy a tub and some cleaning chemical to soak it in, or buy some special thin bristle brush and watch a video to educate myself on how to DISASSEMBLE and clean a BOTTLE. Disassemble should not be associated with a bottle. It should be unscrew, shove it under the water and scrub with dish soap for a minute or two, rinse, dry. There should be no crevices outside of the screw of the lid onto the bottle. No corners. No moving parts. It’s a bottle, not a spaceship. What do I have to do, buy a dishwasher and educate myself on how to dismantle it just to use my thermos? What a joke. It’s a bottle. Bottle, lid, unscrew, clean. The only difference between this and any old recyclable Poland spring bottle should be the thermal capabilities, material and volume. THAT is easy to clean. Just a thick water bottle. Not rocket science. Not some Michael Bay Transformer with more parts than the international space station. Get your spring and button and rubber out of my water bottle. Im sure this is fantastic for people with a dishwasher or a lot of spare time. I don’t have time to learn about bottle mechanics. I don’t even have time for this review but I need to write this in the moment to quell my stress about. I don’t have money for fancy brushes and cleaning chemicals or a dishwasher. Easy to clean? Easier to return.",negative,mug
"I loved this thermos until it destroyed brand new electrical equipment and cost me hundreds of dollars . while sealed inside my bag. The thermos was great first,  but I noticed the twist lock inside the unit seemed very loose but never failed,. only a 2-4 cm turn held it in place inside ...the inside of the unit has a screw down area that holds the auto lock to the top inside and I assume makes it removable for cleaning . it is not held by much and I assume a slight knock in my back set it loose, thus falling into the tea and leaving the spout COMPLETLEY open and then having the tea our all inside my bag destroying everything. has this happened to anyone else? I assume a faulty design. really upset .",negative,mug
"I loved this mug - it kept my coffee hot, fit in smaller cup holders (like the ones in my work truck), pretty easy to take apart the lid for cleaning, and spill proof (if the lid is reassembled correctly).Then, the lid broke.I had read the reviews and answered questions about the mug prior to purchase so I knew that the customer service at Stanley was supposed to be quite good. I contacted them July 21, filled in the online form detailing my mug, and requested a replacement for the broken lid. Within a day I received a reply stating a replacement lid would be on its way and to expect it the first week of September. Not ideal, but I was willing to wait as the mug worked so perfectly for me. On September 14, I requested an update via email and received a response telling me they'd let me know when it shipped. Further emails requesting updates were sent October 21, November 11, and December 12 - in the last two, I suggested that they just send a replacement mug. It's now January 18 and I've only received auto-responses from their ""customer service"" to any of my requests.I'm done.It's a great mug - the customer service not so much.UPDATE: After posting my original review, I once again reached out to Stanley via email. And - whether it was in response to my email, my review, or a combination of the two - I am happy to report I actually received a response from a real person! A couple of weeks later, I received a replacement mug. Still not impressed that it took 6 months for a resolution, though...",negative,mug
I have tried to return for replacement but the system just loops me back to nonreturnable even though the thermos is defective. I bought it in August and didnt notice it was not very good at keeping tea hot untill October when temperatures started to drop. It would only be warm by coffee break and luke warm by lunchtime. I've had a Stanley thermos on the jobsite for over 50 years and never had this problem. My guess is the vacuum seal on this one is flat out NOT. It's warm to the touch after filling with hot tea and transfering the heat to the surface and cooling prematurely. Just give me a new one please before I jump ship for a different Manufacturer.,negative,mug
"I preheated this 16 oz. mug with hot water, then poured hot coffee in it. The first thing that I noticed was that the top portion of the mug was warm to the touch (not insulated well). Within an hour, my coffee was too cold to enjoy. (I have a Yeti 20 oz. Mug that keeps my coffee hot for 6+ hours without preheating.) I am truly disappointed with Stanley’s mug.",negative,mug
"Whenever I try out a new ""leakproof"" coffee mug, I always turn it upside down in the kitchen sink before putting it into my work backpack for awhile, until I am confident it won't ruin my laptop or anything else.. I've only had this mug  for a couple of weeks, have cleaned it daily, and TWICE it has started spurting out hot coffee - not dripping, but spurting - and it won't even stop when I turn it back upright so it sprays coffee all over the kitchen counter and the floor. Utterly disastrous. I'm returning it right away.",negative,mug
"When this tumbler works it's great. It keeps liquid hot for longer than any tumbler I've tried. However, the lid is two pieces and the inner piece falls apart for no good reason at random times. So if you put this tumbler in your purse, full of coffee and the inner piece randomly falls off, you end up with a purse full of coffee. The idea is great, the design gets an F.",negative,mug

"I also have a Tough-to-Tip Admiral's Mug made by Stanley and have been very happy with it. So, I decided to purchase a second Stanley travel mug. Well, this one leaked when the button wasn't engaged and no matter how securely it was closed. Returned it the same day.",negative,mug
I own several Stanley products and this product should be redesigned. It does not keep coffee hot for very long. I did a temperature comparison check with this Stanley product and an Zojirushi SM-SA60BA Stainless product and after1.5 hours the Stanley was 6 degrees cooler than the Japanese product. Don’t buy the Stanley unless you want Luke warm coffee.,negative,mug
I guess I didnt believe all the reviewers who complained about the horrible plastic taste. I thought either they had overly sensitive taste or they didnt seriously attempt to mitigate the problem with baking soda and vinegar as suggested. I chose to believe all those who had no problem with a bad taste. Mine is unusable. I tried the baking soda/vinegar soak to no avail. I suppose I could keep trying that but for 20 bucks I'll just throw the darned thing away. Live and learn.  P.S.  It is really bad.,negative,mug
Cute but that’s it. It leaks and gets everything full of coffee or tea or whatever you have in it. It’s also almost impossible to keep the cover clean. It has so many corners and unreachable places.,negative,mug
"I was so excited to receive this mug. It's absolutely fantastic looking and I've had the same Stanley thermos for year and I absolutely love it. This mug arrived and it was a thing of beauty. That all changed the first time I used it. I then gave it  a second and third try before returning for a Contigo. This mug is not leak proof, the seal doesn't always seal so it's a 50/50 shot if you're going to get leaks or not. Also, I had it leaking coffee out of the actual trigger. So every time I pushed the trigger in to take a sip, I also got coffee on my index finger which is not very desirable. One last down side, the trigger is located so high that you have to hold the mug in a very unnatural way in order to take a sip. I was really bummed because this is such a cool looking travel mug. That said, I'm sticking to Contigo brand because they just know how to make good travel mugs.",negative,mug
I have owned a Stanley for years and loved it. But this new one has a different closure on top. It doesn't keep my coffee hot. Not even for one hour! What good is it? What happened Stanley?,negative,mug

"Very disappointed. My older Stanley flask (~5 years old) was slightly thicker and kept the beverage insulated. This flask feels hot to the touch after pouring in coffee, meaning the insulation isn't working. It's about as effective as a normal ceramic mug. Not sure what's going on but seems like they are cutting corners now.",negative,mug
"I hate to do this because this is truly my all time favorite coffee cup. It never leaks, it keeps hot for hours, it’s durable....except for this one very important part. I bough the first one from a brick and mortar store. After a few weeks the button popped off, exposing the spring. It appears to be press fit. I glued it back on and it worked for about a week before it pulled free again. However, I loved the design and function so much that I ordered another from amazon. Same problem in less than two weeks. These pics are of my replacement from amazon and this 3rd mug is approximately 3 months old. Same exact failure point. Stanley needs to address this issue before it becomes such a common problem that it tanks this product. Again, MY FAVORITE MUG! But this flaw is awful. All 3 times it’s failed, the mug has been upright on a table or in my hand. Had it happened in my soft lunch bag, or in my backpack full of spare work clothes for winter, things would have really sucked. PLEASE FIX IT!",negative,mug

I bought this for my wife who has drank coffee out of some kind of a thermo cup for 15 years. I just bought this for her on her birthday earlier this month. This morning while at the gym she went to drink from the cup. she tilted it and pushed the button simultaneously and the coffee shot out through the drink opening and burned her face. Fortunately the coffee was not super hot so the burns were not permeant. Buyer beware and definitely would keep out of reach from children if filled with anything hot.,negative,mug
I've used it 3 times and now it spilled coffee all over the passenger seat of my new car. I left it on my passenger seat before I could place it my cup holder because I forgot something in my house. Came back after 3 minutes and found this glorious mess.The trigger wasn't depressed and the top was firmly screwed on. Nothing was on top of it but it still leaked like a stuck pig. Thank you for ruining my morning drive to work.,negative,mug
I had a 12oz version that worked perfect until I dropped it.  Since they are no longer available I bought the 16oz.  If you put cold liquid into to it within a minute the exterior is as cold as the interior.  Same goes for hot liquids.  No good!,negative,mug
"It’s a great cup. I bought it looking for a coffee cup that wouldn’t leak if I threw it in my backpack and to that end, I was satisfied. However, after only a few weeks, a clear plastic piece that plays an important role in the lid mechanism broke. I tried reaching out to their customer support to get a replacement lid only and I got an automated confirmation that my ticket was received, but a month went by with no response. I followed up, but still no response. I finally found that they did sell replacement lids, but with shipping, it would be cheaper to just buy a new cup on Amazon, so that’s what I did. All in all a great product marred by inattentive customer support.",negative,mug
"I really want to like this mug.  I had the previous model and lost it.  It liked it a lot.  This one has the mouth piece redesigned a little bit.  The problem I'm having is the rubber piece that closes the hole and the gasket that seals the threads impart a terrible chemical flavor to the coffee.  Its hard to describe how bad it is.  My wife confirmed it just by sniffing the cup.  I tried soaking them in baking soda and water for a couple hours which didn't do much.  I then tried soaking them in vinegar and it helped a little.  Followed by a trip through the dishwasher.  But the next day the problem was back.  I emailed Stanley customer support with all this information and they just told me to read their FAQ which I already had - thus the vinegar and baking soda treatments.  I really can't believe they would use such a bad rubber material in a drinking cup!  So one star because of the bad material and because of the really poor customer service.  I now need to see if there is a satisfaction guarantee - if so its definitely going back, its useless to me.",negative,mug
"I never intended to buy anything from Stanley, because I’m well aware of their quality issues since they pushed production overseas.Ive seen this mug around for quite some time now, and the convenience of one handed operation finally suckered me into trying it out.After using it for a week, I am unable to keep my coffee hot for more than 75 minutes. Even starting the proper way by preheating the mug with boiling water for a couple minutes with lid secured, then immediately pouring in piping hot coffee to the top...no dice. If the ad claimed it could keep my coffee hot 2 hours and I only got one, I’d still be pretty upset. But 6 hours? Really? By 75 minutes it’s already cooler, and right at the limit of being too cool to enjoy properly.I have a tall, wide mouth Stanley (classic hammered green) from the 1980’s (back when they were made in TN) that I purchased on eBay a few years ago, if I put soup or coffee in it, the contents will literally burn my mouth 8-12 hours later.If you like cold coffee, buy this. If you want hot coffee, go find a vintage model on eBay. Their quality cannot be surpassed. Sure they weigh more, but I’d rather lug around extra weight to enjoy my hot beverage.",negative,mug
I’m extremely disappointed in Stanley. For a company the private salt in creating containers for blue-collar men and women this is the worst coffee mug I’ve ever had. I have one of their thermos’s that is nearly 40 years old and Never once had an issue. I got this YESTERDAY took it to work (I’m a journeyman woodworker) it fell off the work bench ONCE and the button snapped cleanly off….I wish I had looked at the reviews before buying this. Stanley use to be the go to for beverage holders so I made the mistake of trusting their name.It’s still functional and I’m not gonna waste money so I’ll try to fix it but I recommend just don’t buy it if you do any sort of manual labor. It won’t last on the job site.,negative,mug

"Last year I bought the 16 oz version of this mug and liked it well enough, so this year I decided to buy a second one in the 20 oz size. I used it shortly for coffee shortly after it arrived and lied it on the seat of my truck (my cup holders are too small). After arriving at work I found it had leaked out all over my seat and bag. I was hoping this was an accident on my part, but I realized the flaw was in the lid itself. If you tipped it over it did not hold the contents of the mug as it’s supposed to. Because my old lid had worked well, I switched it to this one, even though that meant I could only ever use one mug at a time. Today, however, the button to the lid fell off for no apparent reason and I can’t get it back on—rendering both mugs unusable except as open-topped cups, which I’m not in need of.The lid that broke had only been lightly and gently used periodically over the course of a year, so it should not have broken. The other one was broken from the start. That’s $50 worth of mugs that don’t work as intended. Very disappointed.",negative,mug
I have several of these Stanley bottles... Ordered two last week and my mom and brother swiped them because they are so well liked... I ordered another green bottle for me and it arrived used.... It contained pink fluid in the bottle and got all over my hands and counter when I opened it... The leak proof function is flawless.... The bottle looks immaculate and is otherwise undamaged.... My expectations are already pretty low considering how much the quality of Amazon has dropped over the last year with poor delivery time frames and damaged packaging... I sanitized and bleached the bottle  and will keep it since it appears undamaged but I can't ignore that Amazon ain't what it used to be.... shame.... I LOVED AMAZON.... not so much anymore.,negative,mug
"I bought this thermos on June 22nd, 2021 and have been using it ever since. But I have a problem, even though it was claimed to be dishwasher safe, the color of my thermos started to peel off.

"I have bought several of these exact Stanley thermoses over the years, one for every family member and others for gifts. I think they are the absolute best in keeping coffee hot all day long. Until I bought this one. Obviously they have a new design and it did not keep my coffee hot for an hour. I cannot return this because I thought that it was made like all of the other Stanley thermoses are and threw away all the packaging. My fault for that. I will never buy another one of these if this is their new design, which is too bad, they were outstanding before. Don’t buy this.",negative,mug

All the liquid just comes right out. And I actually read a review where someone mentioned this.. i purchased still, giving the product the benefit of doubt. But long and behold I experienced the same exact issue. I feel robbed. I love and need my morning coffee and this is just sheer inconvenience. Back on the prowl for a new mug. But I first had to leave a review. I wouldn't buy without a doubt  and they should work on the cons when it comes to their brand and products.",negative,mug

"Overall I didn’t love this thermos. The trigger mechanism broke after the first use, and I didn’t like it enough to exchange for a new one and just returned it and bout the Yeti. The big bulky plastic lid makes whatever liquid that passes through it taste weird, but I find this happens with most thermos with these complicated lids. The plastic top absorbs the soap and water taste from cleaning and releases into whatever you are drinking. Got the yeti with the slider top and am much happier, even though that one is not 100% leak proof.",negative,mug

"I usually don't write product reviews but I'm just so sick of plastic junk that I need to vent. I bought this a couple of months ago in my endless quest for a good travel mug. It worked great and I was so happy to have finally found my true love. I used it infrequently and with satisfaction until last weekend when I filled it with coffee and went out. I was just sitting in my friends' kitchen and, without anybody touching it, the little spring-loaded valve button flew across the room along with the spring. I was unable to reattach them permanently. So if you're in the market for a travel-mug-shaped paperweight or something to occupy your knick-knack shelf this is just the thing for you. But if you're like me and you want a leak-proof, insulated, drink-without-unscrewing-the-top travel mug that can survive at least occasional use then I recommend looking elsewhere. I'm afraid that's what I'm going to have to do. Again.",negative,mug

"TASTES LIKE PLASTIC! If you really enjoy coffee, this might not be the mug for you.  Looks awesome, tastes gross!  So bummed. I washed the mug as soon as it showed up, the mug AND the vacuum cap, made sure it air dried.  Filled the mug with coffee I drink in the morning at my house everyday into the Stanley mug and the first sip was disgusting! So I figured, wash it again.  Still got the nasty plastic taste.  Figured, Ok maybe I'll just soak it for a day in a small amount of dish soap and water.  Waited a day, washed it off after soaking, poured freshly made coffee into it, sipped...not bad.  Took a few more sips, right back to that nasty plastic taste.  STILL, I've had faith and I've been trying to use it to maybe ""break it in"".  Still nasty plastic taste that ruins the coffee and my morning.  NOT PLEASED.",negative,mug
"I have had three and they've all failed the same way - as other reviewers have noted the button you press to dispense the liquid fails, and you can not re-attach the spring, thus rendering the mug leaky.How did I end up buying something that doesn't work three times? I bought one and after 6 months the button failed - I called Stanely and, after a few months, they sent me a replacement top. Then I lost that one. I bought another, left it in my father's car by mistake and he wanted to keep it so he had another shipped to me. But I already had ordered another one! So at that point I have two relatively new mugs - and within the first month both fail in the same way the first one failed.Do yourself a favor and stay away - it works great until it doesn't!",negative,mug

"I love Stanley products, but when this one arrived the screw on cap had a chunk missing on it. There was no piece in the bad so I can only assume it was knowingly packaged like this. I just wanted my coffee mug so I decided to deal with it. Well now the button you push that opens the spout for the coffee has become a flying projectile in meetings. The spring launches the button across the conference room. I am relegated to shoving an O-ring into the button to reduce the cleaerane fit between the male plunger and the female receiver. My temporary fix has worked for a few days now but I am hopeful that the good folks at Stanley will read this and provide me a new lid assembly. Other than that the mug is great.",negative,mug
"I've never even used this. Once I got it, it became obvious that it is simply not possible to properly clean the lid. Because it doesn't come COMPLETELY apart, no amount of scrubbing or soaking will clean the lid.

So it's not even exposed to frigid temperatures, and I don't see what I could be doing wrong.

This was going to be my new favorite mug being that it always seals instead of is either open or closed.

"I really liked this mug for about three months... then the cap broke and I used it without the push button portion so it was basically a mug with a cap with two holes. Got a replacement from the manufacturer after two months since it was backordered. Things were great for a while and the mug kept everything hot for a long time without ever spilling. However, the cap is not working very well anymore. I can barely push it open to drink out of it even with reassembling it multiple times. Also, be wary of using anything that will spoil with this mug. I have a heck of a time trying to clean it after using cream in my coffee because it's hard to reach some of the lid parts even though you can take the lid all apart. That really grosses me out!",negative,mug
"Stanley will stand behind this product. If you keep your order date, receipt and details handy you can regularly request a replacement lid. The vale button and spring behind it will pop off on a consistent  basis thus requiring  you to submit a warranty claim. You may want to order 2 or 3 more of these so you can cycle them through usage while you wait for replacement parts. Providing you fill out a claim with all the proper attachments you will receive your new lids each time. Just plan for down time on the mug. I finally asked to return them. Never got an answer, I finally threw them away. Still searching for a good replacement; until then I am purchasing and using throwaways.",negative,mug

"I had to post an update. Two things which have now presented themselves which i never thought would be an issue. First when ever you use coffee and juice alternatively, there is an odor that comes from the the cover. I have to wash it a couple of times to get it out. Therefore i would try rinsing it with some hot water or bleach to remove the odor. So first problem solved. The second problem came about when i used hot water a day to remove the odor. When i did that the little black knob you would squeeze on suddenly came out and it can't go back in. This had ruined my thermos experience. i have used Stanley products but this one let me down.DaveJT, another customer had the same issue",negative,mug

Also, when you put hot coffee in it and seal it, it increases the pressure inside, so in addition to leaking it squirts in a great big arc all over your stuff when you pick it up to take a drink. Additionally, the mouthpiece tastes weird, I've run dozens of cups of coffee through it and it won't go away. Such a downgrade from the previous model.",negative,mug
Dents and scratches,negative,mug
"I bought this after careful research.  I thought FINALLY I found the perfect mug.  Easy to clean up, easy to take with me, easy to drink out of.  2 weeks after I got it, the button you push to dispense the liquid inside popped off and would not go back on.  BLAST!  I ordered a replacement from Amazon and got it 3 days ago.  Guess what happened today with my replacement?  Button popped off.  I am sending it back and I bought a different one from Target. I am so very disappointed in the Stanley brand!  It used to be so well made!!  Oh well.",negative,mug
"The button on the cap leaks and gets all sticky. and never seems to dry out after I wash it, even with a whole day of dry time before work the next day! Also the metal part around the top gets pretty hot. Pros are that it's narrow, so it's easy to hold and fits in my cup holder.The search for the perfect coffee tumbler continues!",negative,mug
"This was such an embarrassment for me, I bought it as a Christmas present for my husband, he takes a thermos of coffee to work everyday, he's always amazed that the coffee is still warm by the end if the day. He said when he used this the coffee was ice cold by mid day. He won't use it anymore. I could not be more disappointed. I used it once to sneak wine into dinner with my in-laws... I guess if you're looking for something that can do THAT it's pretty handy. Terrible as a thermos though.",negative,mug
"Beyond disappointed! Half filled with HOT coffee, pushed the button, started to take a sip  BAM a chin and neck covered in hot coffee as it came out of the button area. I expected more from Stanley.",negative,mug
"Abollado, sucio y rayado.",negative,mug
WHERES THE LIFETIME GUARANTEE STANLEY!!!??? Too large to fit in vehicle cup holders in ‘03 F-150. The button assembly does not come apart for cleaning and it does leak if mug is tipped the wrong way while the button is depressed just as others have reported.  The way the lid orperates is awkward and clunky given the large size of the thermos but you get used to it.  Unless you pre-heat with boiling water for 10-20 minutes (which is in the instructions) it does not hold heat well.  My one star rating is due to the button assembly falling apart after 2 months and repeated unanswered attempts at filing warrenty claims.,negative,mug
"Not happy. This was a Christmas present. First week using it leaked a few times all over his lunchbox, second week top completely broke so now its useless.  I don't want a replacement. I don't recommend.",negative,mug
"I have an arthritic hand. This was so top heavy, it really hurt my arthritis. Except for that i loved this! I gave it to a granddaughter! Too bad, its a great coffee mug - shaped well, beautiful in the white, if you dont have issues, get this!",negative,mug
"Went for the cheapest cup I could find and it works accordingly . Simply tipping the cup over spills out , not sealed or spill proof",negative,mug
Doesn't hold temperature as long as Zojurushi. Hard to drink from. Too big to fit in my car cupholders.,negative,mug
Very disappointed in this thermos. Coffee is lukewarm after only a couple of hours. Wish I had not thrown out my 20 year old banged-up Stanley. It still kept my coffee hot for hours!,negative,mug
I have several products of the brand and I have always been satisfied...in this case the product does not store heat correctly...it cools down quickly.  I do not recommend it.,negative,mug
"First of all, let me say that it does keep drinks hot and cold as advertised. So, if I were rating this product entirely on that I would rate it 5 stars. However, the one major flaw is the trigger that operates the opening and closing of the lid...preventing me from enjoying the hot or cold beverage within. You have to hold the mug way at the top and push the button really fast and hard in order for it to work. Even then it only works part of the time. My wife can't even open it at all. I've taken it apart, cleaned it, loosened it, tightened it, nothing works. Perhaps I got a bad one, but I won't risk buying another one to find out.",negative,mug
"This product got really hot on the outside when I poured my mocha in it at 700 am, by 10 am the mocha was cold, no hint of warmth.  Sad my dad lived by an old Stanley all his life.",negative,mug
"the top cover came off  when I was about to drink,  and it splash",negative,mug
"I really wanted to love this. I have two Stanley's already and they keep coffee hot all day but are too tall for my work bag. This keeps coffee hot for 5 1/2 hours. Everything after that is only lukewarm plus it seeps in the afternoon even though it is standing up and less than half filled. Also, it was shipped with no padding and arrived with a large scratch.",negative,mug
Cold liquid.  Leaks bad,negative,mug
I ordered two of them trusting in Stanley brand name. Huge disappointment. They leak! It seems that the quality of Stanley products significantly deteriorated after they started producing outside US. Just do not waste your money unless you want your bag and all your belongings to get wet.,negative,mug
Poor insulation! Have had two older green similar thermos for about 10 years. They keep ice in tea or water over 12 hours (overnight plus). This thermos does NOT keep ice 4 hrs. Would return if had not destroyed packing material. No better than free plastic thermos bottles I have. DO NOT PURCHASE!,negative,mug
"The top of the thermos is very poor quality. The button came off and the spring came off and it is impossible to put back together. It broke on its own sitting on the counter while my husband was eating. It has barely been used. Now Amazon wants me to print a label and return it, but my printer is not working I have to go to the library to print the label and pay to print the label and also pay for my neighbor to drive me to the library and post office. It is very inconvenient and upsetting for me.",negative,mug
I have had this travel mug for about two months and the lid is broken.  Two little plastic tabs fell out and now there is a leak.  I have contacted customer service at Stanley and I am waiting to see if this gets resolved.  I will update this review after I hear back from customer service.Update:Stanley was outstanding in getting me a new lid quickly.  Amazon was no help at all,negative,mug
"Bought this Stanley thermos primarily to take my coffee on the go with me. It worked great at first. I liked the top especially, because it has a button you can press to allow coffee (or anything else inside) to flow out without unscrewing the top. Very convenient.After about two months, the top all of a sudden started leaking a lot, without pressing the button in. I found this out as I opened my backpack to find it soaked with coffee. I made sure the top was screwed on securely and it still leaked a lot.Would recommend other Stanley products to friends, just not this particular one.",negative,mug
"This is a very frustrating product. It has two jobs: 1) keep coffee warm and 2) keep coffee from spilling. It performs amazingly well on the first task; however, that is unhelpful when it fails completely at the second. When you press the ""button"" in on the lid to release the seal, the coffee comes out the drink opening (which it should). The issue is that coffee ALSO comes out the back where the button is. We bought two, and it happened on both of them. Coffee leaks all over your hand on almost every sip. It's infuriating. I did read that the leaking may be a result of improperly assembling the lid, but either way there has to be an easier/better solution out there.",negative,mug
"Three strikes, you're out. I bought two of these from Amazon and one locally - and all three suffered the same poor design flaw. The button that opens the top of the mug falls off after a week to a month of daily use. I've since removed the spring from the button and hot glued the button back in for the time being, but I can no longer put hot coffee in the mug and it doesn't seal firmly. From the factory, the button is friction fit over a plastic post. No threading, nothing really holding it on. After a little use, the plastic starts to give and then the button pops off.",negative,mug
"The plastic lid breaks after normal use. Stanley’s warranty requires you to send it back to them at your own cost. They also say this: If no defect is found and the product is performing as designed, it will be recycled in our facility. We are not able to return used products sent in to us. In order to take advantage of our warranty guarantee, the cost of inbound shipping is borne by the consumer. We are not able to provide shipping labels at this time.",negative,mug
"I bought this a few weeks ago and have been really frustrated. If the thermos is ever tipped upside down, I get leaks from the mouth piece. I’ve been looking at pictures posted by customers and it seems my thermos is missing a a rubber stop that fits over the mouth piece plug. Please note in my photo, I am not pressing the button to open the stopper. Water is just leaking out in its own.As I’ve already been using it I don’t think I can return it. Is there anyway I could get sent a rubber stopper??",negative,mug
"The sipping button fell off the first week. I called Stanley customer service. They told me 1) it cannot be repaired and 2) they were willing to send me a replacement. I didn't fall for that ploy, and then get stuck when it keeps breaking after the return-for-refund period had expired.There was no abuse involved. I never put the lid in a dishwasher. I took a drink, put the mug back in my cup holder, went to take another sip, and Voila! the button and spring were lying on the floor. Without the button, it is impossible to take a sip.Other purchasers have warned about this defect happening to them, too.",negative,mug
This broke within a month or two. The button you press that allows the coffee to come out busted off and couldn’t be put back on without falling off again. It also didn’t even keep my coffee hot for more than 2 hours.  Get the “thermos stainless king 16 ounce” that was the next one I bought and I’m very happy with it. Coffee stays hot for like 4-5 hours and it’s well made. When I say hot I’m talking about like actually hot not just above room temperature.,negative,mug
"Had high hopes despite mixed reviews. Should’ve listened to the negative ones. On exactly my 2nd day of using, the trigger and sealing mechanism broke. Caused quite a stir on my train to Manhattan during a morning commute - there are a car full of people who will never buy this mug either as they witnessed the deluge of coffee running through the train creating sticky pumps, wingtips and loafers. (Although it did add a nice vanilla aroma to the ride)",negative,mug
"Item leaked upon arrival. There was a hairline crack that leaked whatever I put in it. I contacted Stanley since it’s guaranteed for life. Item was not I stock, that was over a month ago. I’ve yet to hear back from Stanley.",negative,mug
"If you like coffee on your khakis or tea on your tees, this is the travel mug for you. If you prefer to actually drink your drink, look for another option.While an interesting design, the trigger action allows liquid to escape from the trigger, dripping down the back of the mug and onto your pants, car seat, and tabletop. Stanley normally makes quality products, but this isn't one of them.",negative,mug
"There is a 3 part lid. Okay, so what happens if one part fails after a week? the mug is no longer fluid tight and leaks whatever, wherever. I bought Stanley brand due to the fact that I have a good history with them. This mug is the most poorly designed mug Ive seen. There is a stop cock on the flange that presses against the outer lid to make it air tight. Well that part is gone. So now?? Leaky, leaky. Am going to try to get my money back.",negative,mug
Leaked,negative,mug
This is the second Stanley mug I purchased. The first one was great except for the cap that broke after a year. This second Stanely cap didn't even last that long. When it did work it constantly hissed from air leaking. It required constant fiddling to keep the air from leaking out. Replacement caps are hard to find. Poorly designed product. Total waste of money. Will never purchase this brand again.,negative,mug
Did not use it 10 times and it started leaking out the bottom,negative,mug
"I really do like this mug, but the build quality is horrendous. I had one for 7 years before it busted and I had to replace it. That being said, the button mechanism broke after one use. I contacted customer service and they said they would replace it under warranty. It’s been 6 weeks and I haven’t received the replacement lid.Used to be a great mug. The new ones don’t live up to the older models",negative,mug
The button on the cap leaks right away garbage,negative,mug
"I don’t know why, but I hate this mug. I never use it because it’s such a pain to have to pinch the trigger action every time I take a sip of coffee. I just use my old mug that flips open. Wish I hadn’t bought this mug. Also, it keeps liquids warm the exact same amount of time as any other insulated to-go mug.",negative,mug
"I am not enamored by the trigger action drinking mechanism, but my biggest complaint stems from the fact that this insulated bottle absolutely does NOT keep my coffee hot for more than 30 minutes.  It is very disappointing.,",negative,mug
"Dont buy it, the spring broke right off the bat, so sad to see with the name behind it.",negative,mug
This mug does not keep anything hot for even an hour and a half. My hot coffee went to lukewarm between 7:30 a.m. and 9 a.m. without drinking a drop yet. Also it has the tendency to leak out the back mouthpiece button. I can't tell you how many times I had to go back and change my outfit because I spilled coffee on my lap. I either have a defective mug or I want a refund because this thing is garbage.,negative,mug
"Extremely disappointed. My big Stanley vacuum bottle keeps my coffee hot/warm for 24 hours. With this thing, my coffee was lukewarm Yoo-hoo by lunch time. I had Stanley replace the first one because the vacuum seal was obviously broken (exterior got hot when hot liquid was poured in) but the replacement did only slightly better. I’m thinking it’s a flaw with the lid design.",negative,mug
Definitely leak proof and easy to hold but does not keep liquids hot for 7 hours.  After 30 min it’s already warm.  After an hour or so it’s cold.,negative,mug
Does not keep his coffee warm as it is advertised.  His coffee does not stay warm past 3 hours,negative,mug
"The mechanism in my old mug died after I don't know how many years of daily use, so I figured same brand, same longevity, right? Ummm... NO! I opened the mug, took the guts out and instantly saw how fragile it all looks compared to the old style. There's no way all those flimsy pieces of plastic are going to hold up. Returned.",negative,mug
"Review on 6/4, had purchased in Feb and button to dispense liquid has come off.  No longer can use with button, it does keep drink hot/cold, but now will not be spill proof.  I am able to take the parts out of the lid to allow liquid to come out, but now there is a hole where the button used to be and will be adventurous if its poured the wrong way and the liquid comes out the button hole.",negative,mug
"I am very disappointed with this one and bothered to refund. I regret to buy one here. I wasted my time buying, waiting, and refunding. This doesn't keep the drink hot for even one hour. Please sell proper ones!!!",negative,mug
Worked fine for a while. Then the lid started leaking. The push tab broke. It’s literally impossible to get a hold of ANYONE at Stanley in order to do a warranty claim on their highly touted lifetime warranty. Calling the supplied number for warranty does nothing. They are a warehouse and they will direct you to call Stanley. And you’re going around in a circle.The cup itself worked great until the push button broke.,negative,mug
"When I first started using this mug it was great, I used it daily and was extremely satisfied with it. Then the button for the mouth fell off and it started leaking like a waterfall. I returned the first one and the second one lasted about a month. I am extremely disappointed in the quality of this product, I was extremely carful not to damage this mug since I knew the button was a weak spot, and still It breaks.",negative,mug
"Worked great until it didn’t. Kept coffee hot all day, but after a few weeks the seal that closes the lid flap fell off. I filled out an online claim at the Stanley website but the only response was an automated one that acknowledged that the claim had been submitted. Ten days later and still no substantive response. “Lifetime guarantee” seems illusory if company will not respond to a warranty claim.",negative,mug
"I really loves this mug, however within a week the button you press to open the mouth popped off, I exchanged it for a new one, but of course it just happened again. Until thw design flaw that allows for this is fixed it won't last more than a few weeks. I'm past my 30 return period too so I'm SOL, in search of a new travel mug, and just added more waste to the planet. Big bummer.",negative,mug
Only had it for a couple of weeks and already leaks from the release button and the spout. It also has that funny chemical taste/smell others have mentioned. Made in china so i should have known better. And so should stanley.,negative,mug
"This mug had a bad, chemical taste when drinking hot liquids.  I ordered a replacement-- same issue.  Stanley support suggested a couple of cleaning techniques, but none worked.  Ultimately I invested a lot of time in a well-built mug that I really wanted to love, but couldn't get past the taste it imparted on my beverages.",negative,mug
"I was so happy about it and it stopped being leak proof. I use it roughly once every 2 days, got it in November 2019 and it June 2020, little over 6 months of the purchase date and it already started leaking. I bought Stanley thinking it was going to last but unfortunately it hasn't.",negative,mug
"El cafe no se mantiene caliente por mas de 2hs y media, la tapa no tiene nada de insolacion!",negative,mug
I ordered this because the Stanley name did mean quality. Sadly not in this case. I have had this sense March and used it once. The top does not work well at all. When I suppress the button on the lid to get a drink the fluid leaks out around the button. I filled it with coffee and took to he car. When I when to take a drink I burnt my fingers and hand and almost had a reck. So I just use the bottom for drinks in the shop.,negative,mug
Bought this mug because the older tops fell apart and a little hard to clean but they did not leak. This new design has leaked on me three times. I like how these mugs hold the heat for hot coffee or keep a drink cold for almost 24 hrs but i guess I’ll have to switch to a Yeti.......,negative,mug
"So I purchased this coffee cup as I’m a coffee fanatic and I also collect coffee cups. After about 4 use the cup was defective so I shipped it back for an exchange, I was shocked when I opened the package the top for the cup was in pieces how could they ship a defective product to me. I believe third times a charm but not in this case. Very disappointed",negative,mug
Too many things to clean inside the lid. It looks cute and you can hold it well…but so do most cups.,negative,mug
"Regarding only the 20-oz. version: I've gotten three in the last week, two from Amazon and one from another retailer. All poured liquid from the closed lid when held upside-down. Co-workers love the 16-oz version, and it doesn't leak ever, according to them. The 20-oz version appears to be missing a critical piece: a rubbery tip on the plunger. By design? I don't know. But the small version has it and big version does not, and I've owned three from two different retailers. Thankful for Amazon's return policy.",negative,mug
"Yep, same issue as nearly everyone else...button pops off and cannot be reattached. I liked it so much that I duct taped it back on, which really only worked for a few days. Tragic flaw really, I hike/rock climb/camp a lot and also do fieldwork outdoors for a living and I would purchase a few more of these if they could simply fix the button.",negative,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Use one or two times, then you ready to surprised by coffee spoilage on your clothes on your car seats.",negative,mug
I had high hopes for this travel mug. The trigger action is very difficult to hold open particularly when driving . I don't have the finger strength to continually hold it open while drinking.,negative,mug
"This mug is great with the exception of the push button on the lid. We had one break and returned it for another because sometimes when things break, it's a fluke. We have had the 2nd mug now for about 2 months with minimal use, limited wear and tear and the button broke again. Unfortunately, this time we are unable to return it.  I can say with certainty that I will not be purchasing another Stanley mug.",negative,mug
"It keeps coffee ""warm"" for an hour. It's advertised as 7 hours. This was a complete waste of money.",negative,mug
"I've only used this cup 4 times since Dec as the spring requires a lot of pushing to open but loved the red color so much and tried to use it again. Poured hot tea in it, pressed button to release some of the steam and tea shot out from around the button hole! I would like to replace the lid.",negative,mug
"Very disappointed in this as even through it's a double wall S/S lining it don't keep hot drinks hot. I even preheated it with boiling water, but it didn't help. Luke warm after two hours.",negative,mug
It is not keeping my coffee hot,negative,mug
does not keep contents hot at all! 170 degree liquid lost one hundred degrees in 24 hours to room temperature of 70 degrees don't waste your money or time with this tin cup with a lid,negative,mug
Does not keep coffee hot more than 15 minutes.  I must have gotten a dud!!!,negative,mug
"Bought to use when sitting in a tree stand. Way to noisy. Every time you depress the button to take a drink, there's enough noise emitted to scare away all critters within shooting range and even those that are not in range.Also was a bit disappointed with how short of time it held my coffee hot. Have owned numerous Stanley Thermos over the years and this is one of the worst.",negative,mug
"Its been over two months and there is still a bad taste (chemical taste) that makes my coffee undrinkable.  I tried cleaning it with accordance to stanleys website, with rice, vinegar, let certain components sit in vinegar and soap for days, and still horrible taste.",negative,mug
Los productos Stanley son buenísimo solo que el mio lo recibí así dañado me llego el día de hoy y es una lastima que el control de calidad de envio no sea bueno,negative,mug
Useless piece of kit. From boiling coffee to room temperature coffee in 90 minutes and I am in Florida so no winter freeze here. You can feel the heat radiating through the sides immediately. Only useful as a hand warmer and I don’t need one of those. Save your money.,negative,mug
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Arrived scratched around,negative,mug
Does not hold heat for very long. Not what I expected out of the Stanley brand.,negative,mug
Leaked the very first use. Returned.,negative,mug
I have owned several of the smaller ones and they have always kept coffe hot for several hours. This one does good to stay hot for an hour. I don't know if the insulation is diffrrent or what. But I am very disappointed in this.,negative,mug
Coffee and was warm an hour later,negative,mug
"This cup was sooo good the first few months I used it. Now that the cool weather is upon us, I have been using it again and realized after it spilled all over that its possibly missing a small piece thus making it no longer leak free.  Too bad because it was really good for awhile.",negative,mug
No converva nada ni frío y caliente,negative,mug
Poor design - you have to continuously press the button to allow beverage through the sip hole.,negative,mug
"The button on the lid fails!  Mine did not last one day.  When you push the button to take a drink, liquid comes out around the button and goes all over the place.  I didn't read the reviews before purchasing because it had so many good reviews.  I am returning this product and would not recommend this product.",negative,mug
"This Thermos travel mug is a great size at 16oz for taking coffee or other hot drink on my commute.However, the lid is too complicated, with 4 separate parts that you have to remove before washing - then it’s too difficult to get the parts reassembled correctly.The handle makes it easy to hold the travel mug but there’s a rough spot along the top edge where the handle bends down - this is scratchy.Overall, I’m disappointed with the experience for this mug.",negative,mug
"I thought that buying from a reputable firm with such market place longevity as Thermos would result in a great purchase, but this product gets a 1 star rating. The thermos is top heavy and quite prone to falling over when empty, and the reason is because the pouring mechanism cap is over engineered with several parts that together add considerable weight to the upper section part of the thermos. This cap also does not consistently seal, frequently resulting in spilled liquids, and it is diffcult to clean. They could have made this a great thermos with a very simple cap design that just partially unscrewed open. The only positive characteristic of this product is that it has good insulation properties. Very disappointed. I do not recommend this Thermos at all.",negative,mug
"The no-handle version of this is great.  I have had one for years and I finally had to replace it because the plastic parts to make the lid no-leak failed.  I thought I'd try the version with a handle.  Unfortunately, some dimwit design engineer decided that it didn't matter if the handle was  placed so that you could drink directly from the openings in the lid.  The lid has two openings with a switch (from close to open) so you can use either opening.  This really didn't matter in the no-handle version.  But when you put a handle on the mug, that handle needs to be placed so the openings in the lid don't end up next to and opposite the handle.  The way this mug was built, I have to hold the mug unnaturally so I don't spill the (usually hot) contents all over my face and front.The mug is leakproof (until the plastic wears out) and it does keep it's contents warm.  But that doesn't matter if you can't drink out of it without contorting your wrist and forearm to keep from spilling.",negative,mug
The good is it was leak proof and the temperature stayed for a long time.The bad is it was hard to get the lid in the right place.  It took several attempts to get the opening lined up with the handle.The worst was after 10 months pieces of black started to show up.  I would go to take a drink and a thin piece of black would be on the rim.  It looked like some kind of coating was coming off.,negative,mug
"Quite apart from whether this is an effective travel mug (and it seems to be), I am angry beyond words by the stickum that Thermos has used to stick their labels onto this mug!!  It apparently CANNOT BE REMOVED!!I have tried nearly everything:  Rubbing alcohol.  Goo Gone.  Soaking for a long time and trying again.  Soapy water.  I eventually turned to Google and then tried vinegar on a cloth, olive oil on a cloth, soaking with WD-40 for a while and then rubbing.  And on and on.  Since it is a pretty brushed metal surface I did not try using a metal scratchy because I do not want to create two blemishes on the side of the metal cup that I just paid (a lot of) good money for!See the photos that I posted.  The sticky areas can clearly be seen.Thermos should be ashamed.I would ask to return it and get another BUT I would probably still be faced with the same problem all over again!",negative,mug
"I ordered 2 of these, 1 silver and 1 cranberry. As far as I can tell, they came from different vendors. The silver mug arrived with a small dent on the bottom edge - not enough to make it wobble when resting on a flat surface, but still...More annoying is the fact that there was a heavy paper band around the body of the mug with product description info on it. Instead of being secured with an easy peel off adhesive, it seems like the manufacturer used something akin to gorilla glue, so when I removed the label, it left behind a sticky residue. I have run it through a dishwasher cycle, used nail polish remover, even used a rough greenie (contrary to the manufacturer's instructions, so as not to damage the finish, which it has, slightly), all to no avail. While some of the gunk has yielded to my efforts, much of it remains.Now that the mug is ""damaged,"" I know I can't return it, so I'm stuck (pun intended) with a mug that looks like crap and feels glued to my hand when I grab it around the body.BTW, the cranberry mug had no such label, and seems fine in all respects.",negative,mug
Handle crumbled in few months- thermos customer service is terrible awful and bad.  It is all made in China regardless the brand!  The brand is only a cover for bad products!  The company is so busy taking complaints that they won’t even answer the phone!,negative,mug
"I took the label off it and the handle was rocking immediately. I would not know about leak, ease of use or cleaning because it was defective out of the box. I was not cheap and the other brand I was replacing with this worked for MANY year. I am BUMMED.",negative,mug
"It would not seal correctly, not matter what I did to try & make it work. The fourth time it randomly dribbled coffee on my shirt & pants (always dribbled enough to get both), I gave up. I never knew when it would happen-3 or 4 cups then the 5th one, it would get you, at the start, half way through-you never knew when it would happen. Too bad-it kept coffee hot for 2 to 3 hours!6-29-19 Update-I found that if you over-fill the mug, as in up into the threads, coffee gets trapped above the seal as you screw the top on, giving you a nice coating on your shirt and pants. But even if you're careful and keep the level low when you put the top on, it will randomly and without reason suddenly spill coffee on you. What idiotic design would put a seal down at the bottom of the cover and NOT on the rim where it should be! Stay far away from this expensive and over-engineered piece of junk.",negative,mug
,negative,mug
"The label would not come off and to remove it I tried (in ascending order) soap and hot water, WD-40, Goop, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, paint thinner, turpentine, toluene.  The last one worked, but not easily. I still had to peel the label off and scrape it with my fingernails. I used detergent to get the residual solvent off.  WHY would they mar an otherwise beautiful surface with a glue that is that refractory?This is the 3rd Thermos mug I have had and in every other way they are terrific.  But unless you want a permanent sticky label on the outside of your mug, buy some toluene and use it with protective gloves.Added comment:  It turns out that the mug was defective in that it wouldn't hold the heat.  Amazon was great about it and they sent a replacement mug which works fine.  However, I had the problem of getting the sticky label off.  For what it is worth, K2r worked very well.",negative,mug
"I bought the THERMOS Stainless King Vacuum-Insulated Travel Mug, in matte steel.Screwing the lid on and off requires Herculean strength. Not matter what you do, getting the lid to tighten to a location that is convenient for sipping is impossible. The numerous nooks, crannies, and layers of material in and around the lid collect coffee, cream, and sugar, but are hard to clean.I threw the useless filthy lid in the trash, then dropped the mug in the recycling bin.",negative,mug
"Brand new thermos, and sticker glue that wont come off even with paint thinner.Kudos to the genius who decided to load up every surface of this thermos with stickers.Why do I need 4 stickers on a ""thermos brand"" thermos informing me that I bought a ""thermos brand"" thermos.We are all well aware that we bought a ""thermos brand"" thermos.We do not need 4 stickers taking up 50% of the products surface telling us that we bought a ""thermos brand"" thermos.Sticker glue refuses to come off the brushed stainless even after being scrubbed with industrial cleaners such as paint thinner.The outside of the mug looks like garbage covered in all this glue.Maybe 4 years of wear and tear will clean it off.",negative,mug
"This Thermos cup keeps coffee hot but is constantly leaking. No matter how tight the lid is on the cup there is a leak.  This is very frustrating especially if you're ready to go to the office and get coffee stains on your newly dry cleaned shirt. Too late for a refund, but buyers beware.The open and close feature is strange as it puts the open portion on the side of the cup and not where you drink from.",negative,mug
Plastic pieces around the lid broke right away and the plastic strip on the handle is already popping out. Just kind of cheaply made. Keeps my Bearded Brothers brand coffee nice and hot in the morning!,negative,mug
"The one good thing it does is keeps your drink hot for a long time. The bad, if the lid is not on tight, it will leak. If the lid IS on tight, it does not line up opposite the angle of the handle. So basically I have to hold the handle almost directly out in front of me to drink my coffee.  This is why I don't like the screw on lids. I was hoping this one would be different. The other thing I don't like is that it makes my coffee taste like metal. Its been washed several times and I just can't seem to lose that taste. Sorry Thermos!",negative,mug
"Maybe it is just me and my clumsy hands, but putting the white silicone (?) band back into place after cleaning the mug was impossible for me to do by myself. I have other Thermos products that work well but I had to return this one.",negative,mug
"I’ve used this particular thermos mug for years. It keeps things hot all day. The lid, however, is horrible on the new one. I contacted thermos because when I took the lid apart to clean it. The lid would not go back together. They did send a new lid and it’s as bad as the first one. I’m using the pretty new mug with my old lid. Not ideal. I’ll be trying some new coffee mugs instead of this. It’s a shame",negative,mug
"After a few months of usage of two mugs, the lids have been a royal headache. Very hard to clean, they leak and we stopped using the mugs altogether. Buy another brand with a simpler lid. Save yourself a lot of troubles.The cherry of the cake is that they don't warrantee the lid!!!",negative,mug

"I bought this product at the end of July. The lid has to be screwed in a specific way or liquid will drip all over you. The mug keeps the liquid piping hot, if you're using it for coffee, so be careful about being burned. The gasket on the lid broke last week and it is not covered by the warranty. $3.75 plus shipping for a replacement. This product is a piece of junk. Do not buy it.",negative,mug
I had purchased the previous model of this item that was painted and had to replace it because of the paint peeling off.  This one is stainless steel and very much an inferior product.  It does not keep the coffee hot for anywhere near the length of time of the previous models and now on top of that the top has come apart making the cup useless.  Will not purchase a Thermos item again!,negative,mug
Liked the old model much better.,negative,mug
The entire mug leaks. Even after we made sure the top was on right. Will be returning this mug for a refund.,negative,mug
Stupid stickers wouldn’t come off and when I tried to scrub them off with soap and sponge it scratched the outside.  It was a pain and in the end I threw mine away the same day I got it.  It looked awful with brushed metal look from me trying to get the sticker glue off.,negative,mug

Not an issue of seal not fitting or grommet needing tightening, it no longer seals nor will it open all the way, so useless with the lid.

My son lost his Thermos last Summer so I bought him one for his September birthday and he used it for abouth 3 weeks or so and the handle broke off!  He didn't want to go through the trouble of returning it, so he threw it in the trash.  Will I ever buy another one  Maybe for myself but not for him because I think he screwed the top on too tight.",negative,mug
"Closed the top. Carried it at my side. Leaked coffee onto my clothes and ground. False advertising? Worsening quality from thermos? Manufacturing error? I broke it somehow after two uses? Not sure, extremely annoyed and will just buy a yeti. Maybe it should be sold as “kind of closed” instead of “closed”",negative,mug
"I sent this to relatives with disability, gift wrapped as a Christmas present.

"We have used these coffee mugs for quite some time now. In fact, Thermos is the only brand we buy. My husband needed to buy a mug to replace his old Thermos mug. When it arrived and after he had taken all of the thin plastic covering off of it we noticed that the bottom of the mug had a dent in it. He kept it and used it because he desperately needed the replacement. Otherwise, he would have sent it back. Disappointed.",negative,mug
I was excited about my purchase. The Thermos looks of good quality but the handle broke off on my first use. Do not waste your money’,negative,mug
I've had the mug since February and use it daily.  Cap closure stopped working. It just spins not opening or closing the sipping mechanism. Not worth paying $25 for a product that is not durable and not useful after only a few months. Thought this was a company I could trust. Will Thermos care?The Starbucks mug I had previously lasted several years.,negative,mug
Why did Thermos discontinue a winner!  The old lever operated tumbler was the best mug ever.  I have been buying them for 20 years! Nothing like it. You press the lever to open the hole and drink and it closes so it wont spill in your car when you don't have the lever pressed.  Or you can lay the mug on the floor and it wont leak.  I went to buy some more as mine disappear and it no longer exists!  I cant find any replacement.  This big clunky mug sure isnt what I want.  Everyone in my house rejected it so i returned. Now we all fight over the last thermos lever mug….,negative,mug
Bought this to take back & forth to work.  Easy to carry with the handle and  fit in the car cup holder.The part that covers the outside of the handle came off after 3 weeks.  I can't find it.  Don't know where It fell off. .  The inside of the handle is now  exposed  I would imagine that it will get pretty nasty sooner than later.  The lid is not real easy to clean  either.  I have to spend more money after only 3 weeks on a replacement.  I am disappointed  in the quality  for the prince and the brand name.,negative,mug

Liked everything about the mug with the exception of something  peeling off the inner lining. They must have flash coated it with something to protect the metal and make it smooth. In my case they overdid it or something😬,negative,mug
The lid that slides to open and close is not tight enough when it’s closed and leaks.,negative,mug
If I could give lower than one star I would. This company’s coffee mugs use to be great. I’ve ordered two and should have returned both of them. The first one leaked so I just figured I would keep that one for home use and another for travel… it leaks too. Wow… just wow!,negative,mug

"These are not original Thermos mugs.  I have purchase probably 40 or so of these mugs in the past (not due to poor quality, but because I have a bad habit of leaving them sitting on a shelf or somewhere else at various stores.  These mugs look similar to the original Thermos mugs but even when preheated with hot water before adding coffee the cups will keep the coffee hot for perhaps 3 hours or so.  They have always kept my coffee hot for 7-8 hours and very warm for another 5 or so.  I probably should have known something was up just by the pure variety of colors offered.  I've never seen them in more than a handful colors.  I am very disappointed with this purchase.",negative,mug
"In spite of the  5 year warranty given by THERMOS,  seller does NOT honour this warrantee, does everything possible to hinder and discourage buyer from refunding or exchanging unit.I have to spend numerous hours, as i am doing now to resolve this situation, to no avail.Note ;  the handle came loose, then fell apart  and spilling hot coffee, handle will not go back on unit.in addition, the lid is NOT spill proof as advertised, it LEAKS terrible, you have to tighten with extreme pressure, but then you can not open lid.  liquids spill and leaks from both openings, can not tell when lid is open or closed.  Anyways, you get the idea, but dont take my word for it, i encourage to buy this thermos, see for yourself what happens, then try to return for refund.",negative,mug

"I don’t consider myself an engineer or product designer by any means, but it seems to me the basic principle of a travel mug is to prevent the user from wearing or decorating their car with the hot beverage that they have entrusted to the mug for safe keeping. This mug however deviates wildly from that principal. The first time I tried to use it I came to the conclusion that a martini glass would have been better suited for containing a hot liquid while driving, or making any sort of sipping motion, for that matter. Even the most gentle of sips results in fluids gushing from the threads in a manner reminiscent of waves crashing on a rocky shoals, kids playing in an open fire hydrant, or a steaming geyser erupting through the air. I’m always one to give something the benefit of doubt, but after reseating the threads several times and trying desperately to enjoy my coffee, alas all I ended up with was burned hands, wet pants, and cup holders that contained far more of my beverage than my stomach. I stoped at a 7-11 and the nice gentleman there let me have one of the free cups that comes with their coffee, and unsurprisingly it did a marvelous job at containing a beverage, as it was designed to do, for a fraction of the cost, despite the environmental ramifications of disposable mugs. In short this product is garbage, it has but one job, and it fails miserably. I’m not sure how the people at Contigo sleep at night on the piles of cash they must be laying in. They have harmed the environment by wasting resources to build this thing, undoubtedly ruined countless outfits, flooded more cars than a hurricane, and forced users to waste unmeasurable amounts of fuel returning this trash. Basically I don’t recommend this product and I would advise you to not order it having been forewarned.",negative,mug
"Contrary to the description, this thing leaks! No matter how tight you tighten the lid, when you tilt it to drink it leaks from below the lid.  The top of the lid works fine.Drinking hot liquid from it is a bit hard as well since there is no room on to lip of the lid for the liquid to cool unlike some other ones I tried.Cleans easy, but the leaking is a deal breaker - submitted request to manufacturer to replace (just over the deadline to return on Amazon)EDIT - NO Customer service response after a week",negative,mug
"I don't like anything about it.  It's too tall for my Keurig.  It has a weird mechanism attached to the place where the liquid comes out, that is a tiny ball that gets in the way and causes the liquid to hesitate and then spill all down the front of you.  Guess that's what I get for trying to save money by buying an ""add on"" item.  It's useless to me and will go in the garbage.  I now have to spend MORE money to order a different cup.  Who would have thought the liquid in a glass/cup wouldn't just pour out.  I just don't get what they were trying to do when they 'engineered' these!  It really makes me rethink ordering online.  A couple more comments:  I forgot to mention that because I could never get the top to let me drink, I would inevitably have to take the lid completely off - still bad, because the edge is so thin and sharp, it can easily cut you lips unless you are extremely careful.  VERY BAD PRODUCT.Here I am back 2 months later to add even more gripes.  I should have thrown it right out, but I had to have something to use in the meantime, so I kept using it and now find that it leaks even when you have the top little flipper button shut.  It leaked in my purse when it was all locked closed.  AND it leaks around the edge of where the lid screws on when you are drinking from the little flip open hole.  Every time I have drank from this item, it has spilled down the front of my top!",negative,mug
"I was surprised at how awkward it was to drink from.  I noticed another review that mentioned the same problem as well as a similar one on Contigo's website.  Wish I'd noticed them before buying.The issue is this.  The lip of the cap is tall and thick, but the pour opening is small and much further from the edge than one would like.  Net result is you don't so much drink the coffee as pour it on the outside of your lip, burn your lip and hope it dribbles down towards your mouth without spilling.",negative,mug
"I bought this less than a year ago August 2017.  I use it a few times a month. I fill it with black coffee and only use it a few times a month.It started to leak through the drink hole June 2018.I am trying to get a replacement lid.  This warranty process is as follows:1. on the contigo web site, choose the product say what is wrong, attach at least two pictures2. They inform you that it will be 2 -3 weeks for a response.3. 8 days later they send an email asking for a picture of the date code with more questions somewhat duplicating the original questions4. I answer the questions and attach the picture and press send5. the email gets rejected because their email box is full.6. Not sure what to do.  I guess I will attempt to send it later.Additional information.The coffee doesn't stay hot (for me that part is good).  As it cools, it creates a vacuum that makes it very difficult to open the mechanism.  It is difficult to get leverage to open if it is not attached to the base.",negative,mug
"This is the second Contigo Snapseal Byron Vacuum-Insulated Stainless Steel Travel Mug, 16 Oz, Gunmetal that I have purchased.  I thought that I liked this mug when I bought the first one.  Then it started leaking every time I used it.  I thought that maybe it was a faulty mug but I liked the way it keep my coffee warm and the size.  So I purchased another one.  Same thing, after a few months it started leaking all over again!  It is garbage.  Now it is time to look for one that won’t drip all over my shirt and car!!!",negative,mug
"I bought this mug after using a Zojirushi for some time. The Zojirushi definitely kept my drink hotter for much long, I mean burning hot four hours later while the snapseal kept coffee hot for an hour tops.  My only gripe with the Zojirushi was that it was too narrow, therefore would swing all over the place in my car's cup holder. Well that bothered me enough to try the Contigo Snapseal.  The diameter is just right that it fits my cup holder without sloshing around.  My only pet peeve with the snapseal was the lid, but after a few times I got use to it, I just tighten when the mug is on a flat surface as opposed to in your hand.Now the bad part, the mug pretty much fell apart after three months to the day of purchase.  All I used this mug for was coffee once a day, five times a week.  I submitted a claim with Contigo but have yet to hear back, but I hope its something positive.  As for now, back to Zojirushi.",negative,mug
"This mug was great...for about 6 months. Then one day the rubber seal inside the lid came loose and I ended up with coffee all over my desk. I re-seated the gasket and all was fine...for about a week. Now I have to check the seal on almost a daily basis before I close the lid. It appears that the rubber seal in the lid will expand over time and continuously unseat itself. Some one in the questions section of this page mentioned something about re-seating the gasket, then turn it counter clockwise till you hear some clicks, then tighten it up. Really?? This is a coffee mug, it shouldn't require periodic maintenance to work.My wife has the Contigo Auto Seal West Loop model and she has had zero problems with hers, and shes had it for years. This model is a complete failure. Stay away.",negative,mug
UPDATE !! Gee wish I had seen the Videos on this before purchase. NOT HAPPY! The gasket on these 2 mugs leak and are very hard to keep from cross threading and the gasket does not seat to the tumbler . My Wife has one and is a leaker and I have one in a gunmetal color and the end of the top is very sharp where it screws on to the cap and it leaks also and the gasket is bad about moving and very hard to get gasket in the right position to not leak. I was using this to mix the ingredients  in my coffee and it leaks with hot beverage and then I like to use to mix up a protein drink and it leaks hot or cold.... Does anyone know a fix ?? and AMAZON & CONTIGO Can you help?? Anyone got ideas? Thanks for any replies . smileytn1,negative,mug
First week me and my wife loved it. And after a week the o ring gasket was not making a seal. Runed my work shirt. Leak all over the front of my shirt. My wife took it to hospital to keep coffee hot and burned her chest. The gasket got so hot it didn't fit on cap anymore. Sucks because at first it did keep coffee hot up to 7 hours. I think hot coffee stretches the rubber gasket and wont fit edge anymore.more. fix the gasket and i will get it again.,negative,mug
"This cup worked great for about a month, and then it started leaking terribly at the top. It keeps drinks fairly warm and this is the third one I’ve bought. The first one lasted over a year before it stopped keeping drinks warm. The one I bought at the same time as this still works great, but for some reason this one leaks out of the gasket between the lid and the cup. And it doesn’t matter if you tighten the lid down gently or crank it on as tight as possible, it still just leaks. But I am beyond the timeframe to return it to Amazon so I am stuck dealing with the manufacturer and they are difficult to get a hold of.",negative,mug
"I really tried to like this coffee mug.. Yeah sure, I'll agree the materials used are great, easy to clean, durable, and snap seal is a great concept definitely keeps coffee hot! Unfortunately, this mug has burned me a couple of times, because I tilt the mug slowly and nothing, tilt it a little more and nothing, a little more and my lips were burned.. Also, opening the seal is a two hand operation and I prefer 1.. A travel mug shouldn't be so hard to operate.. The coffee mug opening is in the wrong place. It should be on the outer rim. The coffee mug air hole should be made slightly larger as well as free and clear. This air hole is very important and is not functioning properly.",negative,mug
"I liked this cup at first. Then it started to leak.  Looking inside the lid, there is a rubber seal that comes out.  It bunches up inside the lid when you twist it on.  Then it leaks out the sides which makes a mess.  I filled out the warranty info on their website, and to their credit, they sent me a replacement cup.  The problem is, this one does the same thing!!  Glue in the seal or something, but I'm done with their leaky lids now.  Time for a different brand.",negative,mug
I own several mugs of various sizes from Contigo and i love them all. I purchased this 16oz mug for my father as an Amazon add on at a great price but when it arrived (in a heavily bubble wrapped box) i noticed it is slightly egg shaped. It appears to have been smashed a bit during manufacturing. The flat part is at the seam so I'm not sure if the vacuum insulation is still good or not but i told my father to fill it with hot water and see if it leaks into the seam or not. I paid less than $7 for it so I'm not going to go through boxing it up and sending it back. Just wanted to make others aware to look for that defect.,negative,mug
The mug kept things extremely hot or cold for extended periods of time for a few months.I went to take a drink out of it and it leaked hot coffee from under the lid. I thought I had screwed it on wrong so I took it off to reseat the lid. I noticed something floating in the coffee. It was a black o'ring. From my best guess this popped out of the lid somehow which appears to be the reason for the leak. I tried my best to get it to pop back into place with no luck on getting it to seal.Up until this happened this was a 5 star mug.,negative,mug
So it was all good for about 3 weeks and now everytime I take a sip from this cup it leaks down the sides. The inner seal has become stretched and loose and does nothing anymore. This basically makes the cup a useless paperweight. Not so great. What is even worse about this cup is the customer service provided by contigo is utter garbage. They basically told me they would not be able to do anything to assist me in getting a new seal for their product. Nice work Contigo and nice work Amazon for working with such a crap company like Contigo. Congrats all around.,negative,mug
"I initially really liked this travel mug, as it was everything I was looking for: (1) retained heat for my coffee for > 8 hours (2) easy to open drinking lid (snap lid) (3) travel size that could fit in my backback drink sleeve (4) sleek and professional looking. However, within a month of use, the mug is now leaking from the top, regardless of how tight I twist the lid on. I believe the rubber seal or rubber ring is defective and not keeping an appropriate seal. Thus, not only is the coffee not staying warm because of this leak, but the coffee itself is leaking, and has now ruined my queen mattress, my dress pants, two dress shirts, and my messenger bag. If possible, I would gladly return this item for a refund.",negative,mug
"La tapa es completamente imposible de usar.

"Was fine for a little over 2 months of daily use before the seal fell out.  I tried to reinsert but the seal had become too large for the insert hole.Back to the cheap ExcelSteel mug that I bought at TJ Maxx years ago.  It may not be leakproof if turned upside down, but it doesn't leak when I drink.",negative,mug
I had it for 4 months before it hit the trash can. I started having problems with the lid seal two months ago. The seal would fall out and at times leak under. I tried to find a replacement seal with no luck. No luck on replacement lids. The  Contigo site was out of stock on lids. People complained on their site with the same robo service replying back. Save your money and don't buy  Contigo.,negative,mug
"The cup has great construction. Materials are top notch. But there is ONE HUGE PROBLEM that is a deal breaker.  Because if the design of the lid, coffee and liquids get trapped in the mechanism. No matter how much you wash it, you can't get it clean. Within two days, the lid smelled like rotten milk. So every time you go to take sip, you smell rotten milk. Can't be good for you. The lid mechanism might even be a liability for the company if anyone gets seriously sick. I had to put the lid in a pan and boil it.  This is just not going to work.  This cup, while it looks great, is heading straight to the dump.",negative,mug
"My bottle cover developed a loose seal, so I contacted contigo trusting they’ll honor their limited lifetime guarantee.

About 10 days later I received an email claiming that this particular one was out of stock, however they will give me a different one providing I send them more pictures and write an essay... this model is still being sold, didn’t want the other one, and I think it’s absurd to ask for so much detail for an $11.00 item.",negative,mug
"This was a replacement for the original that I ordered.  The original was sent back because the gasket would not stay in place inside the lid.  That gasket is what makes the cup leak-proof.  Now, the replacement cup had the same problem.  It's exactly 1 month past the return date which means I can't return this replacement cup.  Worst experience I've had with Contigo cups.  This one was a waste of money.",negative,mug
"The RUBBER RING GASKET DOES NOT STAY SEATED, VERY OFTEN COFFEE LEAKS.Did is very obnoxious; have to use the end of a spoon and push the ring into the groove, and often just will not seal properly - AWFUL!",negative,mug
"Agree with the reviewer who said it is ""a near miss"".The Good: Size and shape are perfect. Keeps liquids cold/hot very well. The closed position seal is very good. You can shake it without leakage!The Bad:  1. Severe tendency of the top to ""cross thread"". Threads poorly designed (speaking as an engineer). Almost impossible for kids to use and hard for adults. I thought this might be a single sample defect but Amazon sent me another one (love 'ya Amazon) and it is no better.  2. Poor (pour?) shape of lip causes spills on your shirtfront. Makes you feel like a dope in the middle of a meeting!",negative,mug
The hole to drink out of is so small that the coffee or water spills every time I try to drink.  Also the top is time consuming to screw on.  You have to adjust it just so or it screws on crooked.  Because of these flaws I haven't been able to use it at all - spilled coffee all over my shirt the first time I tried to drink from it - so can't say whether it keeps the coffee warm for a long time or not.,negative,mug
"Used it for 5 days and there is not even one time i can open the lid with one hand -I have to literally open the lid to drinkThe lid has to be exactly at the center to be closed, if its not you wont feel its not closed properly, and all drinks just start to leaking out when you drink.Just buy something different, i dont know whats going on with this design",negative,mug
"It's impossible to open the drinking spout more than about 1/4 inch.  As others have done, I cut off the spur on the opening device inside the top but that didn't improve it much.  It's back to an overpriced Starbucks cup I guess.",negative,mug
"From the first time I tried to drink from it, it took some time to get used to it, trying to screw to lid and making sure it was on right. And what finally did it for me was when on my way to work I spilled coffee all over my shirt. The seal inside came off. (@$&#%%) I would not recommend this to any one.",negative,mug
"I thought this was a good cup.  However, after using it three days to take coffee to work, it started leaking.  I couldn't get out the door without getting dripped on.  I would not buy another from this company.",negative,mug
"I bought this in February and I loved it AT FIRST, but then a month later it started leaking! It’s nothing worse than not only having scolding hot coffee leak all down your arm while driving but already staining your work blouse first thing Monday morning before even arriving to work. I was super bummed, because before this leaked I loved this thermos!",negative,mug
"The lid on this thing is incredibly difficult to open.  It cannot be opened one handed.  Requires two hands and a lot of force.Like many contigo products, it does t keep hot for very long, but it is spill proof.  It’s also drink proof too since it requires so much effort to open.To me, it wasn’t even worth $5",negative,mug
"At first, this was an amazing travel mug but today, when i was making my coffee, I noticed that the rubber tip that keeps the cup closed popped off.Luckily it was a cheap bottle, but still. I would have hoped it would of lasted longer than a month. And of course it breaks once I'm passed the date to return.",negative,mug
"I bought 2 of these as I read all the positive reviews.  Unforunately, both of my travel mugs starting leaking within 30 days of purchase.  The inner rubber gasket, seems to become loose/stretched out and causing the leaking.  Have no idea why, as I hand wash both parts; the lid and tumbler.  I will be contacting Contigo for a replacement or refund.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.",negative,mug
The twist on lids have a plastic gasket that falls out and/or twists after first use causing the lid to leak badly after the first few uses.  I bought two and was very disappointed.,negative,mug
"Surprisingly this is the worst product for Contigo. I've had over 5 Contigo mugs over the past years, but this one isn't working at all. It doesn't seal the worm coffee for more than half an hour. I received my order then complained about the mug, Amazon sent me a replacement, had the same issue. It's this model that doesn't work properly compared to other Contigo products.",negative,mug
"I bought this travel mug about 4 months ago and it just started leaking. It looks like the normal wear and tear from my commute was too much for the rubber gasket inside. It's leaking out from around the threads on the lid pretty severely. It did do a good job keeping things hot and cold but unfortunately, I will have to find something new.",negative,mug
"I can't believe the good reviews. This cup is almost impossible to use.  I burn my upper lip when drinking because the design is flawed.  It's a terrible mug and I wish I had tried it soon enough to return it.  Plus, it definitely does not keep coffee hot for an extended period of time as I thought when purchasing.  I relied on the good reviews and that was a mistake.",negative,mug
"This is complete garbage. I've had it for a few weeks and it's spilled on me three times already. It's hard to get the lid on, and even when you think it's on securely, it might not be. There's no way of knowing until you drink out of it and it spills all over your shirt. I wish I could return this and send them a dry cleaning bill for my shirts. I've heard Contigo makes good travel mugs - this one is NOT it. Just a horrible, horrible mug that is definitely not leak-proof. On the plus side, it keeps the coffee hot for hours.",negative,mug
"I normally dont write reviews. But this one has me in a fix. Overall the item is good and durable, but two things abt it bug me!1) Its not leak proof, though the decription says so. Or may be I have recieved a faulty item.2) The snap to open the cup is too tight and incovenient, esp while driving.",negative,mug
"No matter how carefully I try to close the lid (and it can look like it's sealed), my beverage spills on me. Not sure where the leak is even coming from but it's a mess. (Picture: driving on highway with hot coffee spilling all over you)Unfortunately, I ordered this and moved overseas so that I have no way of returning it! Just wanted to make sure others didn't experience the same frustration.",negative,mug
"I used it today for the first time. I put my hot coffee in it at 7am. At 1030 i took my first sip and it was cold.... so i guess it doesn't keep liquids hot. also,you have to be careful when you screw the lid on because it easily goes off track.",negative,mug
Don’t get me wrong I’m a big fan of Contigo mugs and I bought more than ten mugs from the old design but this one is very stupid as it doesn’t have the auto seal function like the old one and it’s so hard to open so you need to hands to open it sip and close it and of course can’t be used in a car,negative,mug
"Ordered two of these cups about 2 months ago and one of the O-rings in the lid has already stretched out beyond use and doesn’t stay in the lid anymore so it leaks. We use them daily so we need a sturdy, durable, leak-proof cup and these weren’t it. They were nice while they lasted.",negative,mug
"The seal started coming out of the lid within one week of purchase, and once that happens, forget about putting it back into place. Once it comes out and loses a little elasticity, the cup forever leaks. Do not purchase this cup.",negative,mug
It does not keep liquids hot for more than 40 mins. And it does not keep water cool for more than 1 hour. Not a good product at all.,negative,mug
"Coffee cup looked great, worked great for the first couple months. Noticed when I would shake the cup a small hissing sound would happen, then the coffee started to shoot out under the seal. Turning the cup in that direction now will cause a leak. Useless cup now. Didn't even last 6 months.",negative,mug
I have had the is mug for l fewer than 3 months and it leaks around the rim.  Not worth going through the hassle of returning--especially since people here have reported bad customer service for returns.  Into the garbage!,negative,mug
Received this today and was excited to use it for work overnight. Filled it with coffee and went to take a sip and it leaks from all around bottom of the lid. I removed the lid and readjusted it hoping that was the issue and it wasn't. Still leaked. I'll be returning it tomorrow unfortunately.,negative,mug
"This coffee mug drives me crazy - there’s an O-ring under the lid that always comes loose and causes the mug to leak. I finally removed it, which helped, but it still leaks a little bit unless you close it very tightly. I’ve had other styles of Contigo and would recommend those over this one.",negative,mug
"Don't but it! It looks nice, but it does not work well. LEAKS! BAD SEAL!The top no longer keeps a seal with the rest of the mug, which means leaking coffee when you go to drink!I barely used this mug, and I certainly never dish-washed it. Despite this, the mug broke within less than a dozen uses.Listen to the other negative reviews. It looks nice, but it is not functional!",negative,mug
I cannot trust it. Purchased it January 22 and already the gasket on the lid will not stay in place. Always refitting it with a salad fork and then questioning its ability to keep me dry. Done!,negative,mug
The seal Keeps coming out. I had one of these for a few years this one is a few months old keakining as the seal keeps coming out,negative,mug
This cup does not seal easily. Unless you place the seal on the brim of the cup then put the lid on. The seal was loos when the cup arrive and does not stay in the lid.,negative,mug
i bought the same type of mug at least 4 times in the past because it works so well...this last one i received was a damaged product and leaks every where won't close right and my coffee gets cold because of it. i had to change my shirt a few times because it spills.,negative,mug
"Highly rated, good price, bought two, great right? Nope. Leaks, both of them, big time. The seal between the cup and lid is bunk. I’m going for thermos next, wish me luck!",negative,mug
One Piece Of You Know What.  Tried it this morning for the first time and in the trash it went.  Poor A%# design.  Burnt my upper lip trying to gingerly sip coffee on the way to work.  Very little coffee would come out.  Whoever designed this thing was on drugs or didn't even take the time to use the product. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,negative,mug
"The top is hard to screw on, the opening to drink from is too small, and the cap design makes the top hit your nose when you drink.",negative,mug
We have bought a lot of these and love them all. I think it was a fluke that this one constantly leaked every time I took a drink. I had to throw it away.,negative,mug
There claim is 6 hours for hot.  I put hot water in the mug for a couple minutes before i added hot coffee.  3 hours later the coffee was lukewarm.  JUNK,negative,mug
I received in bad contition. I tried to send it back following the Amazon prosudure but it didn't work. The courier didn't know where to send it (even though i had all the proper labels. So they charge 8euros just becouse they send it to Athens at the Anazon's branch and then back to me becouse the branch didn't keep it.) Very very disappointing.,negative,mug
Don’t like it. Happy d to drink from,negative,mug
These worked great like twice. Then the the rubber on the lid stretched out and they became useless!,negative,mug
I think this is fake contigi or I have a defective product. There is no way to close the lid on this. It takes me 5 min every time just to turn it right and close it. So annoying.,negative,mug
I DID NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL,negative,mug
The size of the gasket inside the lid is too big. When it unseats (and it will) coffee leaks profusely when you lift the mug to your mouth.,negative,mug
"Gasket failed after minimal usage. works great when gasket works but...impossible to reseal gasket once loose.Becomes useless, second time happened to me.Would not recommend.Zero stars",negative,mug
Seal not working after one month of daily use.,negative,mug
The gasket came off the lid and I purchased it a month ago,negative,mug
It leaks. One of the circular rubber thing came off from the cap and it leaks. Just after 15 days. Won't recommend it.,negative,mug
"I have the same problem as many others with this mug. When I try to drink the hot coffee, it totally burns my upper lip. Everything about the mug is great, but if you have to wait for the coffee to cool down to drink, what's the point! Serious design flaw in my opinion.",negative,mug
"Lid is very hard to open and almost impossible to close, even while empty.  I tried backthreading it and no luck..  I wouldn't even try with anything hot inside.  Very bad design, not sure why Amazon is still selling this.. there are plenty of reviews stating the same problem, wish I'd read them before buying.  Returning it!!!",negative,mug
"Leaks every single time - don’t waste your money. This has leaked all over several of my bags, my coats and my clothing. The seal works well for a couple of weeks and then fails.",negative,mug
"Not leak free at all, I thought it would be a good deal price wise, I guess I got what I paid for. Super cheap item not worth it.",negative,mug
After one wash the drinking spout no longer sealed. One one the little stopper fell off and can’t get it back on. Can no longer return.,negative,mug
The first time I used it it did not leak. Now it leaks when I drink. I am so disappointed. My return window has closed.,negative,mug
"Here i go wasting my money again... i have been looking for a container that keeps my coffee hot for more than two hours, preferably four. According to many reviews, this Contigo item would do the trick.  What a dissapoitment! It barely keeps coffee hot for an hour.",negative,mug
"I thought I had a good cup,after 4 months it's leaking and noone canhelp, because I've had it for 30 days.Who expect to return an object in 30 days?",negative,mug
"The design of the spout is terrible.  It used the cup several times.  It definitely keeps liquids very hot, but I found it was difficult to drink from because of the half occluded spout due to the design of the lid.",negative,mug
Difficult to close....really doesn’t close completely....therefore it drips after it is “closed “......I guess I was looking for less expensive ...... my bad judgment.,negative,mug
"Estoy solicitando la devolución de mi dinero, pues nunca recibí el articulo... Como voy a devolver algo que no tengo?",negative,mug
After only 1 month of use the rubber seal ring in the lid is warped causing it to leak.,negative,mug
"Not sure how people love this thing. The opening for liquid is very small and odd round shape, definitely not good for coffee use, unless you like real small sips that taste like plastic. Most annoying travel cup I ever tried.",negative,mug
These are junk I bought 2 of these a few months ago and they both now leak and are going in the trash!,negative,mug
"The mug is leakproof; can turn it upside down without spilling out. However, drinking from this mug results in burnt lips due to the design and positioning of the drink spout. I'd rather have paid the few extra $$$ to get a spillproof mug I can actually drink coffee from.",negative,mug
The bottom is leaking so we can’t use it anymore and it says I’m past my return window,negative,mug
"A few weeks after I bought the mug, The lid does not seal AND it began to leak and I could no longer use it!",negative,mug
I’ve only used this product for one month and it ha begun leaking from the lid when I tilt it to drink.,negative,mug

"It was perfect for a month or so, but then the rubber circle on the cap came off and I cannot us either anymore because it spills.",negative,mug
"Burns your lips, as the lip on the lid is rounded over, so liquid flows onto your upper lip.  I got a bunch of burns from this thing.  I HATE IT!",negative,mug
Starting to leak after 3 months of daily use.,negative,mug
Piece of crap. A couple of days after the return window this thing starts to leak from the side. Great!!,negative,mug
Nice looking travel mug but with one BIG problem. The lid/sipper design makes it impossible to drink your hot coffee without burning your upper lip,negative,mug
This item had a strong coffee odor inside when it arrived. It was obviously used by someone for drinking coffee at some point. Not happy at all with getting a used container.,negative,mug

"I picked up one of the Contigo Byron mugs yesterday at Best Buy.I used it for the first time this morning, and I'm not impressed.  My two main things:1.  I'm a 6-foot, 225 pound man and it takes two hands to open the lid.  This IS NOT a ""one-handed drinking"" solution.2.  The flow of the liquid out of the lid is miniscule.  Like I felt like I was trying to suck the remaining juice out of a lemon or something.  I finally just had to take the lid off and drink out of it like a normal cup.Maybe I have a bad one?",negative,mug

Very disappointed after only 4 or 5 time use it started spilling and stained shirts,negative,mug
Started leaking after 5 uses. I always hand washed and never put in dishwasher. This is fine for around the house but I got it for travel. It leaked all over my bag just from walking. Thr cup was upright too.,negative,mug

"have too use 2 hand to open and close, lid looks very cheaply made, very poor disign",negative,mug
"The mug itself is great, keeps coffee hot for a long time and a nice design. But the lid is miserable. I don't understand how anyone can drink 20 oz of coffee at a time through this thing. Keep burning my top lip and the coffee comes out in an uneven way.",negative,mug
The pop-lid becomes hard to open after using. I've had to use a knife to pry it.,negative,mug
The snapseal does not close all the way so leaks,negative,mug
This mug does do it's job well. Within minutes of pouring in a hot beverage the mug fails to keep it hot. In less than an hour it's pretty much room temprature. I like to preheat my mug with hot water so it's not even going into a cold mug. I bought this because I had previously used a Contigo and it did a great job. I'll test this one aganist another brand but there is a clear problem with this model or their production process.,negative,mug

"*Contigo's marine fungi growing systemIt will get you sick!Care and use guide never tells you how to take apart and clean the auto-seal button mechanism.What happens when you are drinking, is the fluid get trapped inside the auto-seal button and ... stays there.According to the use and care manual, you only have to rinse with warm water while pressing down the auto-seal button.But there will be still water, unless you keep on pressing the button to dry the mechanism.So better way is, you need to take apart the auto-seal mechanism, which is really hard to take apart and put them back.Also, there are very very small parts and you will lose them while you are washing them.I washed mine in a strainer and one of the small parts (small rubber o-ring) floated out the strainer before I knew it!I found this out when I opened the Contigo to refill my water, I noticed floating pink objects...Which was water fungus... YUK",negative,mug
"I will spare you the disgusting pictures of what lurks underneath the movable lid part. I decided to see just what could be underneath that movable piece so I pried it off with a flathead screwdriver...and OMG. There is no possible way to clean under there or dry under that because it is not designed to be removed.  Now I loved my Contigo cups- been using for years b/c they don't leak and keep my coffee hot- I've had many. After seeing this, I threw all 3 of my current ones away and will not purchase again. I wrote Contigo and sent pictures- took 4 weeks to respond and with that, they want a ton more pictures and info. I told them I threw them away (they were disgusting) and that I'm not looking for any compensation, just do something to fix the issue. They offered to send me one ""new"" lid (valued at $6) to put on my cup (that I trashed)- no thanks. So dissappointing.",negative,mug
"Liquids get trapped beneath the moveable cover and the rotating locking disk. That turns into mold or some other anaerobic blight. Leave it out once and it's done-- uncleanable, unrecoverable, unbearable. There's nothing like getting a fresh waft of moldy stank on your morning sip. And what's worse? You can't actually see OR clean whatever it is that stinks so much. Yes, definitely my fault for leaving liquids in there for a couple of days. But the last contigo I had I carried for FOUR years (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HZI5XBG/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1) without nary an itch, through use and misuse. Sure, I had to get out the scrubbing loop once in a while after some particular negligence, but there was nothing ever like the putrid invisible stench like the body of a decomposing diabetic. This one lasted exactly one month and I tossed the whole thing. Also, because of the new style of closing mechanism there is always a dab of coffee left in the sip opening. You have to suck it out consciously or it'll drip a drop. Maybe I'm nitpicking here, but I would pass on this design.",negative,mug

"I love my contigo autoseal to death.  Best travel mug ever.  Keeps things hot, easy to use, lip is easy to sip from (you'd be surprised how difficult it is to get this correct!), spillproof.However, I always had a lurking suspicion that nastyness was growing under the lid that rotates to lock the button closed.  See ya can't get under it!  But I'd soak the lid in bleach solution once/wk, make sure I scrubbed as many of the little interstices as possible w/tooth brush during my daily cleanings.Then after about 9 months, the rotating lid snapped off.  Ugh.  There were some really horrible biology experiments going on under there.  10 out of 10 don't buy this thing unless you're working on hardening your immune system :-(",negative,mug
"I loved my original Contigo so much that, when it came time to replace it, I bought this model immediately.I've used it three times and I am highly disappointed in the purchase.* Every time I take a sip from this, a small amount of my liquid gets stuck in the pouring hole. So if I move it quickly (like when you're driving and need to put it down quickly), the remaining liquid splatters all over the place.* The liquids are definitely not staying as hot as they do in my old model Contigo.* The reservoir lid and push button do not work as well as the older model.I will not be buying this product again.",negative,mug
I gave it one star because it is pretty!  LOL!.  Drinking out of this is a challenge.  The hole for the liquid is so small that you can barely get any liquid out.  Think of drinking thru a pinched straw...yeah.  For the most part it is leak proof.  If it falls over it does not spill. BUT if you do not get the lid securely screwed on (and it is tricky)  it will spill down the side of the cup.  It keeps liquid hot but not for 5 hours.  I  forgot I hadn't finished my coffee...and after 3 hours I drank it.  It was lukewarm.  I am so bummed!,negative,mug
Bought 2 of these based off of “Contigo” products I’ve owned in the past and to be entirely honest this coffee mug is the worst cup I’ve ever owned. 1st and most important It does not keep coffee even remotely warm for more than 30 minutes. Second is that it gets extremely dirty under the top cover that twist to walk and is really annoying because you have to clean it all the time. It is a really attractive car when it comes to appearance But it does not keep coffee warm at all and is extremely messy when it comes to cleaning. Are used it for a week and I’m not using it again. I would not recommend buying it unless you plan on drinking coffee in less than 30 minutes.,negative,mug
"I have MANY Contigo products and have given many as gifts as well. The latest version that was featured on Amazon Deal of the Day is NOT GOOD. I would have expected that things would only get better for a product I have found almost no fault with-- Until now.This version leaks and 'features' a removable, spin lock cap that is supposed to lock the beverage dispenser. I suppose if you use that lock, it works. But it acts more as a place where your beverage seeps out to and then spills onto you when you when you're drinking a beverage.If you remove this poorly designed cap, you still have leaks.Not what I would have expected from Contigo. It is an absolute STEP BACKWARD and I would have returned if I could at this point.DISAPPOINTING",negative,mug
"Nice enough mug, but the lid is impossible to clean.  Noticed that liquid was starting to come out at a trickle, and figured that air was being blocked from coming in while liquid was going out.  I disassembled the top of the lid (for which you need a special triangular head screw driver) and was confronted by a thick, black, moldy sludge filling the air inlet.  Unfortunately, you cannot disassemble the rest of the mechanism inside the lid to clean everything.  Through the lid away.  And yes I scrubbed with a brush and ran the lid through the dishwasher....the lid is just very poorly designed and is totally impossible to clean thoroughly.  Too bad as I liked this mug and own other Contigo products which I absolutely love.",negative,mug

However, when I clicked and bought the product in November 2020, only on the purchase page did it reveal the 16 oz. capacity. I needed the autoseal functionality, which it has, so I took it. In addition, the Gocontigo.com website only has the 1-page pdf identical to the product wrapper, so there is no detailed information on disassembling the complicated top.

"I really wanted to love this coffee mug, but it leaks terribly!  It does its job of not spilling when you are not using it, and it seals very well.  However, when you push the button to release the fluid from the top, coffee seeps out and leaks from under the lid cover.  I typically have to drink my coffee with the lid off to avoid spilling.It does, however, keep my coffee warm for a VERY long time as long as the lid is on.  I can pour my coffee at 7 am and it will still be warm 4 hours later!  I just wish it didn't leak :(",negative,mug
"I've been buying Contigo cups for almost 10 years now.  I loved how they used to keep my coffee hot from 7:30 am until lunchtime at work.  This new cup I just got DOES NOT even come close to that!  Maybe an hour, if that!  Very disappointed.  It is pretty, but that doesn't help keep my coffee hot!!  Will be hunting for a new brand.  :(  Also, Amazon took 7 days to deliver.  Come on, why am I paying extra for Prime??......... :/",negative,mug
"I own 2 other contigo auto seals and love them.  Bought this one to keep at work.  Unfortunately the design is not as good.  There is an indentation under the top for a rotating sealing device to slide.  When I drink from the contigo, a small amount of liquid (for me, coffee) accumulates in that indentation and then drips.  In my case, on my pants on the way to work.  This may be a personal issue depending on the type of lips you have (I have large lips).",negative,mug
The opening seemed to be too small; coffee emerged to slowly to get a good taste. Perhaps they focused excessively on avoiding leaks!,negative,mug
"Consistent with other reviewers' experience, this Contigo Autoseal Transit leaks from under the rotating sealing cap.  The drips come without warning and have resulted in stains in many a dress shirt in the morning.  I rode it out for as long as I could using my trusty Tide pen, but I can't take it any longer.  I have been a loyal Contigo customer but I'm moving on from Contigo for a bit to try another manufacturer's product in this competitive product line.",negative,mug
Unfortunately the black contigo metra is slightly smashed at the bottom of the bottle and lid got whitened because i put coffee inside. Its steam made it get whiter and i dont know if this should be this fragile since it must be its nature to keep the hot beverage inside. The full lid which we twist to open the bottle has white paint rips therefore it doesnt seem all black. What should i do? I dont want to use my contigo like this. I dont know how i am going to send this product back to you. Could you please help?,negative,mug
"Trasncurridos 3 meses de uso, me percato que comenzó a tener pérdida de calor. No se conserva la bebida fría y el termo ""suda"", es decir, el frío interno se refleja en el exterior (Cosa que NO DEBE PASAR) y condensa la humedad. El termo no ha sido golpeado, de hecho lo he tratado con extrema cautela. Por alguna razón perdió el vacío entre las paredes.",negative,mug
"I loved this mug for so long, but not any more. I was religious about cleaning it after each use, but there is a spring in the lid that I couldn’t scrub as well as I would have liked without taking it apart. Well today, when I opened the lid, something black and disgusting was oozing from the spring. Do NOT buy this mug.",negative,mug
"I hate to write a bad review, but this cup fails at its one job; it doesn't keep coffee off my shirt.  The fancy top that covers the drinking hole has lots of nooks and crannies that trap coffee, so even though nothing comes out unless I hit the button, I still end up wearing quite a bit of coffee by the end of the day.  The other Contigo model that doesn't have the cover is awesome.",negative,mug
"I bought this for my son in laws birthday.  I was so excited to give it to him, and when he opened it up, he was very excited to get it.Two days latter my daughter told me he’s had nothing but problems with it leaking all over him.  He uses it on his drive to work.  I was hugely disappointed that something I was so excited to give him was such a phenomenal disappointment!!",negative,mug
"I have several of the old style, and they work well. This one looks nice, and I especially love the rubber on the bottom. But the groove for the lid collects liquid when you drink and then drips all over you. I am forever taking off the cover lock to dry out the groove. And the blue ""accent"" gets stained easily, too, and is hard to wash, so it always looks dingy. I would not recommend this product to anyone.",negative,mug
"Don't recommend this product. The idea that keep the liquid from leaking with the ""360 degree spin"" is great, and i really like it. However, it was difficult for me to clean it. There is no way for you to take them apart for cleaning. Especially when you put coffee, tea, soda or other liquid that contain sugar, they will dry off when leak inside the cap, stink afterward. ONLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT WHEN YOU JUST USE IT FOR PURE WATER.",negative,mug
I have had this cup for a little over two months. I use it probably 3 times a week. I loved it at first but last week it started leaking right above the contigo... it runs down my face and have had multiple coffee spots on my white shirts I wear under my scrubs at work.Dissatisfied 😕,negative,mug
"Unfortunately this cup LEAKS. The cup's lid design with the rotating seal has a design flaw. Liquid seeps in to the area underneath the rotating cover, and drips out when I tip it back to drink out of it. It seals fine at the mouth opening, so liquid doesn't pour out, but dripping down the front of my shirt is a problem for a ""leak-proof"" cup.",negative,mug
"Not sure why Contigo thought the design on this cup lid was ""better"".  If you like to grow things that you can't see that are not good for you then I guess it is a success.",negative,mug
"I just received the contigo mug today.  My complain is because when I opened the box, the mug was dirty with a kind of glue all over it.  I don't know if it is used or what, but I am very disapointed to see the state of it, when it is supposed to be new.  I put it in water to see if I can remove that strange glue.",negative,mug
"I buy my coffee mug with a view to keeping my coffee hot. This one said 5 hours. My coffee was lukewarm in 2 hours and that inside a warm apartment. If you are looking for a cup to keep your hot drink relatively hot for 5 hours or more, this isn’t the cup.",negative,mug
The product is great in terms of keeping the coffee hot for 5 hours however within a week’s use the white color started peeling off. I wish the quality of the paint was better.It seems once the peeling off starts the product will need replaced in a month or two.,negative,mug
"Cover for the water channel already lost in my first plane trip, 3 months of ownership.That’s it, it fell somewhere and I can’t find it. I thought this was supposed to be more firmly attched, but I guess I was wrong.",negative,mug

Leaks and didn’t keep things hot or cold for described time.,negative,mug
I didn’t realize until too late (hadn’t opened it and was gifted to someone else) that the top cap was missing a portion of the lid that is neccessary to make it functional. Also there was a huge gash in the side that was worse than just cosmetic because it made it uncomfortable to hold. Boooooo.,negative,mug
Doesn't keep coffee hot as claimed,negative,mug

This leaks big time!  I am so disappointed. A lot of money for a cup that does not seal.  Made a mess up n my lunch tote. Do not buy this one.,negative,mug
Item was filthy with coffee stains inside and on the cover. Even after running through dishwasher plus hand scrubbing I don’t want to drink from it. This is the first time I’ve been completely dissatisfied with an Amazon purchase.,negative,mug
I used this mug twice and the top broke after I followed the directions to take it apart to wash it.  What a total waste of money.  Don’t buy it!,negative,mug
Worked great for a few months and now the top is leaking out the sides when I take a sip. I worked great until that happened now it is useless. I wonder if I can get a replacement cap,negative,mug
Looks nice but you won't be able to drink from it without dripping down the front of your shirt. The previous design was much better.  I think we're at the point of just throwing this one in the garbage and replacing it with the older model.,negative,mug
This is the 2nd one I have ordered.  The first one the lid was broken when it was shipped.  The second one I have not had all that long and it is already leaking.  I used to like Contigo not anymore.,negative,mug
"Spills from the sides. When opening the security turn lid protection portion, shoots out hot contents from both side due to pressure build up. Junk and dangerous!",negative,mug
Use it for milk every morning and wash it in very nicely everyday. It's 4 weeks of regular use and the lid has started to smell like rotten dairy. Its obvious that drink is getting caught and unable to clean it thoroughly. So disappointed. Would not recommend.,negative,mug
"I loved this cup, but after just 2 months it no longer keeps beverages hot and I can feel the heat through the metal. So disappointed.",negative,mug
I've had this item for only a few months and it's already leaking. I bought this alongside a contigo auto seal waterbottle which also leaks now. Very disappointed in the quality of these products and how long they have lasted.,negative,mug
Bottle is horrible. Leaks. Very hard to drink out of. Spills out once you slide the lid closed.,negative,mug
This is over-engineered and it did not work for me.,negative,mug

Horrible. Broke within one week of use.,negative,mug
Didn't keep coffee hot even though I had preheated it with boring water.,negative,mug
These are a positive hazard — for your clothes. It drips and stains shirts with whatever you drink because of the poor mouthpiece design. Terrible design.,negative,mug
It’s a good product I own a lot of contigo things,negative,mug

"I've had many Contigo mugs, most ended up lost or smelling like creamer left in too from when others borrowed them. What one never did was break! They're indesructible! Idiot leak proof! They keep drinks hot! They were the world's greatest mugs.Until I washed them just now. Two older ones with older style lids? Totally fine. Dear god, this one? My favorite one because it matches my Osprey Talia backpack? I'm throwing it away. I had some vinegar and started moving the sliding locking top piece. Something black floated up. Then again. And again. And again. More... mold? Congealed tea and coffee? Whatever it was churned my stomach and made me greatful I didn't get sick.It was horrendous. I never got it clean. I repeated ten times. I could soak in vinegar but there's no way to clean in there and there will be... things growing in the sliding top part that locks.I'm throwing away all my mugs in case there are more hidden places for the black death to hide in there- whatever those nasty little black bits were is disgusting.Unfortunately, I'm now back hunting for a new coffee mug that is me-proof, but also won't grow... something. Whatever that was was not meant for human consumption.",negative,mug
"I had had an older contigo mug which I loved, but it was getting older and so I purchased this one. Not only does the mug not hold temperature for longer than about an hour or so but coffee drips into the grip and it is nearly impossible to remove. The push n seal is difficult and uncomfortable to use and the mechanism inside is like a magnetic for bacteria and sludge. I tried to contact Contigo directly but it's been over a month and I have yet to hear anything back. I loved my original cup and would have stuck with the snap seal if I had known this cup would be like this.",negative,mug
"Got this as a gift based on such great reviews and it barely kept my coffee hot an hour and is hard to clean the top portion of the lid where the button mechanism is. Also, I don’t like having to push a button and hold it every time I want to take a drink. My old thermos brand that I bought 10 years ago is far superior. Looks like I will get a new one of those and return this!",negative,mug
"I had the classic Contigo travel mug and it's been great.  It was washed so many times that it started getting a dishwasher taste so I thought I would buy a new one so I bought this new autoseal mug because it looked good and thought Contigo made the best travel mug. After one day, the plastic above the vent on the side cracked.  Didn't seem a big problem but it may have affected the rest of the mugs function.  The need to rotate the plastic piece to reveal the drinking side of the mug is slightly annoying but if you keep it exposed the mug leaks slightly. Not horribly but enough to be a problem.  I could live with it but a week later the entire rotating top fell apart and I had to throw it away.  Not recommended.",negative,mug
Advertised as spill proof: completely untrue.  Drenched my belongings & leaked often.  Questionable ability to truly clean the lid.  Skip this trash & just get a Yeti.,negative,mug
"The lid rotates to open or close the drink hole. Every other time I turn the lid, it kind of lifts off the swivel and I have to forcefully push it back into place. There are better options. A year later, I have stopped using completely because the lid always smells like old dirty plastic, no matter how well I wash it.",negative,mug
Cup is not the usual from this company. Look elsewhere,negative,mug
Poor quality and customer service,negative,mug
Love the cup but the lid cracked right away.  Wouldn't buy another one with the same anti-spill mechanism because the plastic is obviously too weak to be turned back and forth all the time.,negative,mug
Not a Fan - I bought this on a special deal of the day or I'd return it. I'm not happy with the lukewarm coffee I have after just an hour and I don't like the pour spout. I would not recommend this one. It's going in the donation pile.,negative,mug
Yeah...unfortunately my coffee stays hot for about an hour and that's it. We have a stainless steel contigo one that's giant and that keeps the coffee super hot. 5 hours is an exaggeration.,negative,mug
My bottle full on the ground. Then the cover doesn't work.  This cover was too weak .,negative,mug
Not worth buying drinks only stay hot for an hour,negative,mug
"My review after 100 days:This mug has gone downhill. Read my 90 day review below, but in the last two days, paint has been chipping off the top edge where the lid attaches to the body. i.e. the chipping paint is right *on* the edge and may end up *in* the mug or certainly in my mouth when I drink with the lid off. See photo. This will only get worse, now. This product has gone from average to awful. Do not buy. Contigo's ""lifetime guarantee"" specifically excludes paint chips.My review at 90 days:For 90 days, I have used this, sometimes twice daily. TL;DR: It's okay. I give it 3 Stars right now.It has not leaked but it does always retain a few drops of coffee in the recessed part of the lid when you drink, and it's not easy to shake or suck that liquid out. So it's safe to put into a bag of other items *before* you start drinking, but expect a few drops of ""leakage"" after you've used it. (Only from the exposed area of the lid.)It's not particularly easy to clean. I also have, and love, a Zojirushi mug. Their fiddly bits in the lids of these two brands each require different cleaning attention, but both mugs have them, so I'd give this mug only an average rating for ease-of-cleaning. I was expecting something better based on their marketing but it's average. Note: If you throw this in the dishwasher each time, I guess that makes it easier. I prefer to quickly handwash after using it in case I use it later the same day.It does *not* keep a hot beverage hot for very long. Daily example: pre-heat the mug with a cup of boiling water while brewing, then dump out the water and put in piping hot coffee at 8am. It's nice and drinkable (not quite ""hot"") at 11:30am when I first unseal it. That's okay. But in a Zojirushi mug (also 16 oz, and notably *smaller* than this mug), I still have truly hot coffee at 2pm.The lid retains a strong coffee odour, even after washes and soaks by hand and machine. Every mug with plastic bits seems to do this.It seems reasonably durable. The black paint or coating has started to wear off near the top lip where the lid screws on.So this is my daily knock-around mug and it's fine. But I recommend a Zojirushi mug if you want the best heat retention and build quality.",negative,mug

"Not worth the money spent. 1] Paint chips off on Day 1, 2] Does not keep anything hot, 3] seal is poor...... in short waste of money. do not buy. Giving 1 star only for the looks.",negative,mug

I am super disappointed in this product.  It didn't keep coffee hot or even warm for more than an hour.  Terrible design. Don't waste your money !! I wish I has listened to the reviews more carefully.,negative,mug
"I regret purchasing this mug for the following reasons:-- it does not keep my coffee hot for much longer than 30-40 minutes.-- something about the spout's design makes coffee pool up in the lid, such that it drips all over me when I'm drinking it AND when I'm just holding it. After using it for a few minutes, I look down and my clothes are covered in coffee lol.-- the autoseal button feels way too flimsy and cheap for $33-- the rotating lid does not detach from the mug itself, making it impossible to fully clean. I have read other reviews about this lid developing mould inside the lid.I regret having purchased this one instead of the regular West Loop, because the rotating lid on this model seems more like a hindrance than a help. That being said, I won't be buying a Contigo mug again.",negative,mug
This mug does do it's job well. Within minutes of pouring in a hot beverage the mug fails to keep it hot. In less than an hour it's pretty much room temperature.,negative,mug

"Let me say we're big fans of yeti products, but not so much this one.  It has wider diameter than most travel mugs, so not as comfortable for smaller hands.

"Product arrived dented in the bottom, which is amazing as these are well made and I have dropped my old one many times without a scratch. This damage needed to be a strong impact!",neutral,mug
I love this cup however the lid isn’t leak proof and you can easily spill hot coffee or tea on yourself if that was fixed it would be the perfect cup,neutral,mug
"They say dishwasher safe. Well, it won't melt in the dishwasher but it will ruin the finish and the lid seal. I had to request a replacement for my copper 20 oz. tumbler.  Hand wash only. Wait until the coffee (or whatever) is at a drinkable temp, because after you put the lid on it will not cool. Have bought more and will again. I like my current white tumbler. Good product, wish they were honest about how to wash it.",neutral,mug
"This product does a decent job of keeping beverage warm. My biggest issue is the lid, it leaks. This is not the cup to go into your bag. (searching for a better option for this) The other issue is that coffee stains the clear lid and the only way to clean it is to sue bleach which makes the lid cloudy.",neutral,mug
I bought it thinking and expecting it would keep my coffee hot for at least an hour.  Ice would remain solid for a very..... long... time.  But not so good for hot beverages,neutral,mug

"This item leaks through the Magsafe lock closure. The content bubbles out from the edges when any amount of liquid gets in contact with the lid. This makes carrying drinks almost impossible unless the cup is only partially filled. Its ability to insulate and keep drinks warm for extended periods of time is very good. I got this. ittem primarily to take drinks on the go, so its a bit let down that it leaks.",neutral,mug
"3rd purchase from yeti,great cups BUT i didnt recieve the mag slider that closes the drinking port",neutral,mug

The lid is removable, actually magnetic but again it does leak.On a good note, Amazon stood by their commitment to refund.  I'm not a expert on tumblers, but i have had better. A better seal would make this a different story.",neutral,mug
"Pro:-Keeps my coffee hot/warm for hours. I’m really impressed by this. Temperature-wise, this is the best travel mug I’ve ever had.Cons:-It leaks when tipped over. I thought the lid closure would prevent it, but it doesn’t. I have to be careful when I take it to the dog park.-I’m an adult with small hands. (I wear childrens size gloves). It’s *very* hard to hold the mug in one hand. I should’ve gotten a mug with a handle.But:I’d highly recommend it for someone with average/large hands who’ll just be using it at home or at the office.",neutral,mug

"No need to review a Yeti cup - we all know the quality. But I ordered 8 of these in White to be engraved for a company event, and they arrived thrown loosely in the box without any sort of bubble wrap or anything to protect them. They were all scuffed up and needed major cleaning to get scuff marks off. Please package these EXPENSIVE cups better next time!!!!",neutral,mug
"The design is very clean and trendy. Very easy to clean. *However* it spills, every little bump will make your coffee come out of the top. Unfortunately, few of my textbooks got coffee stains now.",neutral,mug

There was a small dent in the bottom of the cup. Quality control issue or robot packaging? I couldn't tell ya.  It made me sad because I had waited to long to open the package.,neutral,mug

"                    The media could not be loaded.                 On recommendation I tried this tumbler. I went half way on the review stars: As far as keeping my coffee hot, this thing was amazing! Since I commute by bus, I bring my coffee in with me to my desk and I'd say that an hour or two into the day my coffee is still on the hot side of warm. But the whole thing fails in the spill department - Zero stars in that regard (see video). The seal around the edge of the lid is decent, but the drinking clasp - Pointless.  If you use public transport or want to carry this in a bag, forget it. Needs to be held upright at ALL TIMES.Edit: So, apparently this is such a problem that there is a huge number of ""replacement lids"" available that do work. If you want to spring for another $10, you can get one. Why, Yeti... WHY? Why do you make a lid that doesn't hold the liquid in when you have a design that does? Who would want a travel mug that doesn't hold liquid?",neutral,mug
"So this product originally came without the magnetic lid part.I contacted customer support and the magnetic part was shipped to me free of charge.Unfortunately, said magnetic lid still leaks. If you tip your cup so the liquid is against the mouth part, it's going to leak for sure. I originally bought this because I wanted a leak-proof tumbler, and this unfortunately does not meet the standards.The cup itself is designed well -- it is very wide, so it will hold a lot of liquid for its height, and the textured outside walls are comfortable to hold. The wideness of the cup lets me wash the interior of the cup without needing a bottle scrubber.The temperature-holding aspect of the cup seems ~okay~. It's not as good at holding temperature as my other thermos, but it's not bad for a cup I'll sip throughout the morning (hot tea cooled to ""warm"" after about 3.5 hours).The plastic lid part is easy to remove from the cup because there's a small tab to pull.I imagine that the lid being plastic allows temperature to change more easily, though.Overall, I'd say that you can't really use it as a replacement for a thermos; it'd basically only be able to replace a cup.--- ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW ---This cup was advertised as having a fancy lid with a patented magnetic lock.Unfortunately, it appears as if I don't get to experience it, as my lid came without said magnetic lock.",neutral,mug
"My fiancé wanted a Yeti to replace her badly dented Simple Modern brand tumbler. She, as was I, under the impression that this $50 Yeti would live up to the hype and be far superior. Her old tumbler has a straw through the very insulated lid, so I ordered the straw replacement lid for her yeti adding an additional $10 or $12. There is no type of gasket around the straw opening in the lid and the lid is not insulated at all. I know that it came with the slide opening lid, but that has no insulation either.Long story short, the Simple Modern brand tumbler has been left in the car for days at a time and still had ice in it. Left in the car in Chattanooga in August! The Yeti doesn’t keep ice overnight in the air conditioned house.The only redeemable thing about the tumbler is that I was able to get the exact color she wanted.The Yeti tumbler is definitely inferior to the Simple Modern tumbler…at nearly twice the price. I’m sure the neighbors would be impressed if we put the Yeti sticker on the car, but we were not at all impressed with this grossly overpriced, inferior product.",neutral,mug
"I love the cup, but never received the sliding lid",neutral,mug
Was very excited to upgrade to a Yeti Tumbler - I ordered the 20 oz since a 16 os was not available on Amazon.  It is very well made but too large and too heavy for my hand to comfortably use.  And I did not realize that it was going to cost me $5.99 to return the product to a UPS location.  The nearest and may be in the only location in Phoenix to return the items is the Phoenix International Airport Location - too heavily trafficked plus I would have to pay for parking.  Very unrealistic.,neutral,mug

"Update: Day 5, it leaks from the spout. I went to give someone a hug while holding my Yeti. The spout was closed, and it leaked all over both of us! And it doesn’t keep my coffee hot. So that kinda worked out in this situation for both of us...but I’d rather drink hot coffee, than lukewarm. Changing my 4 stars to 3. I think I’m going back to Contigo....Today was the first use. I previously used the Contigo Snap Seal, but the rubber washer ring failed and started to leak.Pros: I liked the vacuum seal lid. I had leak issues with the Contigo lid. There are no rubber washers to deal with.  It did not leak. Some reviewers said theirs leaked. First day, no leak! I liked that there are not a lot of grooves to clean. I’m not worried about mold buildup or coffee stains because the lid is clear and not a lot of grooves to get into. I had that issue with the Contigo.Cons: It did not stay hot. I left the spout hole open and it was cold within 3 hours. That would not happen to the contigo.  I also didn’t like that it didn’t have a handle. As a mom to a toddler, I need a handle. When your kid is demanding you hold all of his belongings, you need a handle. So I shelled out an extra $10 for a handle. Seems a little steep. The width is also an issue for my cup holder in my car. It’s too wide, and with the handle it’s worse.Conclusion: TBD. As long as it doesn’t start to leak, I’m satisfied. I’ll update if anything changes.",neutral,mug
"I LOVED this rambler but it has a magnetic slider to close but not sure somehow it has detached and is now lost. I can still use the cover but it no longer seals, unless you buy a new maglider here on Amazon. Now that is a scam. Well I love Yeti products just disappointed with this slider.",neutral,mug
I’m sure the cup is fine  But their shipping department doesn’t know their colors.  Ordered sea foam green.  Received Stainless Steel.,neutral,mug
"This product worked fine but I thought the heat retention was lacking.  I performed a heat retention test with a Thermos travel tumbler. I filled both with 200 degree water, after 2 hours the Yeti was ~130 while the Thermos was 165 degrees.  The item is on Amazon as the THERMOS Stainless King Vacuum-Insulated Travel Tumbler, 16 Ounce.",neutral,mug
I love the mug.  Only thing is it Leaks from the top of the sipping opening when closed when stored in a bag or backpack cup holder.  I guess the swishing of the coffee seeps through.  Holds the heat in well though.  So I just hold it or put bounty over the cover when storing in my backpack cup holder.  The cover that slides is held in place by a magnet.  Perhaps the reasons for leaks.,neutral,mug
"This came missing the magnet slider to cover the mouth piece. The top isn’t broken or anything, it just doesn’t have the part so the mouth piece is open. I’m not too upset with that but others should know that it’s not on the mug. The package came faster than expected and the item is in all forms as described. Woulda liked the mouth cover tho…",neutral,mug
"Claims to stay hot or cold for many hours. It does not. I'm pretty disappointed. For the price and the reviews I was expecting it to stay cold longer than it has. Would not get again. Also the 20 oz.size is a little hard for my hands to hold, a bit too wide. I love the aqua color but I don't think I'll ever use this tumbler again. Rather use the Zak or Contigo.",neutral,mug
"I had a YETI 20 oz. rambler cup for3 years that I LOVED, but, alas! I recently set it on top of my car and drove off. When I realized what I had done, I went back but some lucky person had already found it... That cup kept ice unmelted for over 8 hrs at work, or overnight on my bedside table.I missed it so much that I ordered a new cup. However, the replacement cup is no better than other non-Yeti insulated cups. The ice melts within an hour or so. Hot drinks cool off in about the same time. All this to say, I am wondering if I received an authentic YETI cup...or if I was sold a knock-off. I have other YETI products...including a coffee mug. None of these have proven to be so ineffective as the new 20 oz. Rambler. What to do, What to do? So disappointed in this latest purchase.",neutral,mug
"We bought this for my husband for father's day.  He loves it, but the lid is missing the piece that slides to close the sipper.",neutral,mug

"Warning! The magslider lid is not leakproof. Before finalizing my order based on the description for my first color choice, I switched to another color. After the product arrived, I thought it was defective due to the leakage. Knowing I needed a 'traveling thermos' wondered why I ordered the tumbler. Reread the first description of my 1st choice / no leakage mentioned; checked the description for my second choice / clearly states the magslider lid IS NOT leakproof.On a positive note, after returning the item at the Amazon USP store, my charge card was credited in a timely manner.",neutral,mug
A lot of hype. Overpriced and didn’t hold cold like I had expected.,neutral,mug

Even warming the Yeti Rambler before coffee was added didn’t help in keeping my coffee warm. After an hour or so the coffee was a little warmer than room temperature. It was 190° when it went into this cup.Haven’t tried it for cold beverages yet.,neutral,mug
Doesn't keep my drinks cold for as long as I thought it would.,neutral,mug
"This does not keep drinks hot as long as other options out there, and it’s certainly not leakproof. If I’m walking to my car with a somewhat full tumbler of coffee, it leaks out the top. It’s nice-looking and easy to clean, but not worth the money. I was reluctant to buy it in the first place and am frustrated that I wound up actually making the purchase.",neutral,mug
"So, I love the design and the minimalistic elements of this. I like that it is easy to clean. But beyond that it seems to be a bit of a dud. The tea I had in it was losing its temperature by about 3 hours in. My other issue with this tumbler is that it is stated to be 20oz, but when I poured a 500ml bottle of water into here, it was filled up to the lid. I feel like the name is the major cost here.",neutral,mug

It leeks but will keep your drinks cool,neutral,mug
"This tumbler feels and looks nice (I was a bit disappointed in the color), and it it does a pretty good job of keeping my coffee hot. It does not, however, live up to all the hype I've heard about how long it keeps drinks hot. While it does keep my coffee hot longer than some other insulated tumblers that I've used, it's not effective enough to justify the extra cost. I'm sure there are tumblers that are just as effective at two thirds the cost.Regarding the color, I admit that it's not far off from the color rendered by my monitor in the item description. But I had hoped for something a little more vibrant. It would have been more accurate to describe this item as being ""tarnished copper"" in color, rather than copper. (This did not effect the rating that I gave it.)",neutral,mug
Leaving 3 stars simply because it did not come with magnetic slider to open and close the lid. Now have to place a separate order for one..,neutral,mug
"Its definitely not leakproof.  The magnetic closure on the lid will leak if it is tipped/knocked over.  However that does make it very easy to clean and not end up with mold growing in places you can't clean well.  It alright at keeping things hot (primarily what I use it for) but I've had other, less expensive ones that do a better job.  It's pretty good but expensive for what it actually offers.",neutral,mug
"I’m always on the go and although it is durable, the fact that it is not leak proof is a big negative for me",neutral,mug
"I did not think ahead. I reheat my coffee in the microwave. This item cannot be put into a microwave.  My mistake so overall lower 3 star rank is based on that.Cleaning is a small problem.  Should the ""magnetized"" slider stay attached to the lid at all times or does it need to be removed and cleaned separately?  I can do either but removing this fairly small piece could result in it's being misplaced or lost.  I would have bought something different just for that fact alone.  The mug does keep liquids hotter much longer so if that is what you are looking for, this may be what you need!",neutral,mug
This has got to be the most over rated product I have ever come across. It leaks. Does not keep the coffee longer than any other insulated mug on the market and is expensive to boot. All hype. No substance.,neutral,mug
"This mug is built like a tank, looks great and I love love love the lid! No more unknown twisted lid gaskets to dribble coffee in my lap! The lid fits nice and snug and slides open smoothly and quietly when you want to take a sip. But that is where the love affair ends...this mug is HORRIBLE for keeping things hot. Lukewarm OK but hot...forget it. This mug falls somewhere in between my old leaky contigo and a ceramic mug. It's really that bad. And I preheat my mug and thermos with hot water before using. I can't speak to how it works on cold beverages tho..maybe that's where it shines. One more very positive note is that it cleans up great in the dishwasher..lots better than old mug. So I guess I will just have to drink my coffee a little faster. This mug would be worth the cost if it did a better job with hot stuff but I can't recommend it at this pricepoint for the performance.",neutral,mug
"I had a friend who had this tumbler and he threw it in his backpack when it had liquids in it and it doesnt spill. I hit a bump and mine, closed still seeps out liquids. Plus side my liquids stay hot for a long time.",neutral,mug
"While it does work in keeping your drinks fairly warm or cold, I've had $15-20 tumblers from other companies that have kept the temperature consistent for longer. Also, the lid only does a slightly moderate job if preventing leaks. Of course it's not advertised as leak proof, but you would think for such an expensive product that they would have made the lid leak proof or at least make it more leak proof. If you accidentally knock over the tumbler with the lid on, you will definitely be cleaning up a spilled drink.  While the smooth finish and sturdiness of the tumbler itself feels nice, the whole thing is just a little too big to be able to comfortably grip it (I have medium to large sized hands).On the plus side, the entire cup and lid are dishwasher safe, which I will say is a very nice bonus over other brands.Overall, I'm not overly impressed.",neutral,mug
"2.5 Stars. I'm  really disappointed. I heard all the great things about the Yeti.  How it hold ice forever, how you could sit it in a hot car for hours without melting the ice, blah blah blah blah. Not true. At least not with the one I got. Maybe it's a dudd. I don't bother with returns, but I am seriously tempted to return this. I just spent $29 on 20 oz container that won't hold ice for 5 hours, and it melts consistently during that entire time.  By the way I notice that one of the items it doesn't ask to the customer to rate is ""Does it keep it cold very long?"".",neutral,mug
"For the money I spent on it, it's  doesn't hold things colder/hotter than my Ozark Trail.",neutral,mug
"Does not keep coffee hot for very long, 3-4 most. I was told it would keep for 1-2 days. Ice melts in a half a day.",neutral,mug
Lid leaks... Always had good luck with Yeti but this one is defective..,neutral,mug
"I haven't yet evaluated the insulating properties, but I cannot comfortably drink out of the lid because the opening is too far below the top rim of the list to make a comfortable seal with my lips, but worse, my nose presses against the MagSlider, which makes drinking from it even more uncomfortable. Maybe this is not a problem for people with small noses, but I think I read others have had the same issue with the MagSlider. I haven't tried the regular lid--perhaps the opening is closer to the rim to be able to drink more comfortably without worrying about dribbling, and there is more room for your nose. I tested the lid for leaking, and I do not believe it leaks from the lid seal, but it does drip through the MagSlider, although I'm not that worried about that as the main purpose is to keep it from sloshing out when in the cup holder in the car, and I would think it would do that. I just ordered a YETI Lid with Straw and I'll see how that works. It occurred to me since I won't be using this lid for drinking from the opening, perhaps I can file out the middle of the inner side of the opening to create a rounded recess for a reusable straw. On the positive side, when I reported this problem to Amazon they issued me a full refund, even though they don't accept returns on this item, so I used a little over half of that refund to buy the lid with straw.",neutral,mug
I wanted to return this item but my wife would not return something she used.  We love our other Yeti mugs but this one does not keep drinks warm long at all.  Very disappointed.,neutral,mug
"I assumed the magnetic top would be leak free. I was wrong. I am returning for a leak free mug, cheaper, less stylish, but it’s GD coffee, not shoes. Do NOT throw in a bag!! Do NOT let it fall on a car seat. It’s about a $10 stay hot mug. If it gets knocked over, it’s leaking all over your things. I travel. I am in a hurry. I need a mug that can handle that. Yeti’s are slow. Yeti’s lumber. I don’t. I move. I don’t sit at the camp fire sharing stories about how awesome I am. I go find awesome. This mug is for the slow, coffee clutch life. I’m not.

"When I buy a cup for about $ 30, I expect perfection - no less.In terms of keeping the drink warm - it's fine but not really a hit.I used a thermometer to check. When I filled the water in the morning their temperature was about 90 degrees Celsius.After about three hours the temperature was about 60 degrees Celsius. This is a drop of 30 degrees. I was expecting something better.If you drink your coffee with milk then it cools down even more.But the bigger disappointment was that when I put the cup in my bag, standing of course, in case of displacements there is a leakage of the liquid out through the lid of the cup - which is really, really disappointing.I returned the product back.",neutral,mug

"Solidly built and does not sweat. Unfortunately it ends there. It does NOT hold 20 oz as advertised. Won’t even quite make it filling it to the brim, which of course means you can’t put the lid on. It also does not keep things cold/hot more than a couple of hours, despite the advertisement. There are cheaper containers that do hold their advertised 20 oz and keep things cold/hot 12+ hours. If you’re into premium brand names, go for it with the above caveats. Otherwise look elsewhere.",neutral,mug

I am keeping my fingers crossed now that my coffee will stay warmer that 15$ish Contigo tumbler",neutral,mug
"I love Yeti products, and was honestly disappointed with this mug. After reading the directions I realized that the lid is not at all leak proof, especially with hot liquids. Even the lid itself has a manufacturers note that it’s not the best at keeping hot liquids in. Knowing all that, I tried just plain water with some ice, and kept the tumbler closed upright in a cooler. To my dismay, by the time we walked over front he car to the beach all of the tumbler contents have spilled all over the cooler. For a good product I just don’t understand why would YETI not make a leak proof lid? I’m terribly disappointed because I can’t imagine myself taking this tumbler anywhere except into my car for morning coffee and leaving it on my desk. It would be impossible to leave it in a backpack because it will definitely spill. I’m not sure if the lids I have are just totally defective, but seeing that the label on the tumbler warned against spills I’m suspicious that it’s just not a great lid.If you’re looking for a spill proof tumbler, this one sadly is not it :/",neutral,mug
I bought this to replace a Contigo that I had lost. Yeti is a good brand and I figured I’d try it out. It has to be similar to the Contigo.Nope.Tried it with coffee and just laid it on it’s side briefly with the drinking hole closed and had leaks at the opening and around the sides. Additionally it doesn’t keep your coffee hot as long as a Contigo does.The best thing about this is it’s dishwasher safe which my Contigo is not.I’m sure people who love expensive brand name Items love this but I’ll go back to a Contigo and stick with the brands I know and trust.,neutral,mug
"It was leak proof, easy to hold and easy to clean. However, I purchased 2 and both of them do not keep the ice as well as our previous Yeti’s and the inside bottom got rusty. We hand wash them so it can’t be blamed on the dishwasher.",neutral,mug

The mag slider works smoothly but the coffee comes out of it. Not fast.  But if you tilt it, it’ll drip. Was really hoping for a tight seal, but you’d need rubber gaskets on the mag slider to make that happen.Didn’t keep my coffee hot for as long as I thought it should either.Ah well. Will not buy their coolers.",neutral,mug

"Ok...I love my rambler, but it took me a very angry customer review to Yeti to finally understand the lid is NOT supposed to be leak proof.... Idk why you'd want a non-leak proof lid, but here we are. It does keep ice a long time, and it's become my night stand staple. Every night I fill it with ice water, and the ice is still there in the morning! If I take it to Starbucks it fits the grande drinks great, and keeps them cold all day at work. Love it! I have dropped it several times, and the little magnetic black peice on the lid flew off and was lost. Yeti replaced it tho! Which was great knowing Amazon is a certified seller and allows that! Just registered it when I got it. Also, having that peice be removable makes cleaning a lot easier!",neutral,mug

"I'm a little surprised by the design of the mug. For starters, I can't get my hand all the way to the bottom of the mug to clean it. Mostly, it's the thermal design that puzzles me. If you look at the top of the mug, you'll see a metal rim. The metal rim is the same metal that's on the inside of the mug. The metal rim acts as a heat conductor, allowing the heat from the hot liquid to be transferred to the outside of the mug. The mug doesn't keep your coffee hot for as long as it could if the metal rim wasn't there. I bought the mug based on the company’s reputation for making coolers. I’m a little disappointed, there are better mugs out there if you want to keep your coffee hot.",neutral,mug
I’ve spent money on a 20 oz and the 32 oz YETI.  Neither one keeps drinks cold for long.  Ice melts quite quickly.  I won’t buy another one.

"I ordered this ""20 oz"" tumbler thinking it would hold the entire contents of my small coffee pot which will make about 17Oz of coffee in a batch.  Well, this ""20 oz"" tumbler only has a working volume of 16 oz up to the bottom of the lid and perhaps 20 oz to the very brim if you remove the lid.  So what good is a coffee tumbler without a lid? not much.  If you want a travel mug that will hold more than 16 oz, buy something else.  This is false advertising by YETI.",neutral,mug
"Everything about it really good: keeps things super cold or hot.  Big downside for me is how heavy and wide it is.  I'm a senior so it's not everybody's problem. If you have even a touch of arthritis, this isn't for you",neutral,mug
"It's only been about 2 months, and I can't figure out why, but water is leaking from between the cup and the lid.. I guess the gasket is no longer functioning as it should.",neutral,mug
"I love yeti but this one came in with a broken lid. I don’t live close to a FedEx building to make for an easy return, (that’s why I ordered online!) so I’m disappointed such a nice brand delivered a damaged product.",neutral,mug
This is not anti-spill cup. Very disappointed :(,neutral,mug
Receive the item but upon closer inspection the cup is missing the slider that actually closes the lid. When I went to return the item I was offer to return it and get a refund in 30 days or trade it in for a copper colored cup. I dont want to mess around waiting again for a cup to arrive so I just ordered another replacement lid. Frustrating would rather buy in stores next time.,neutral,mug
Magnetic slider piece missing,neutral,mug
"You can't put this cup, after filling it with coffee or whatever, into a bag with other items thinking the top is sealed and your other items, books clothes or whatever will be safe. The one I got leaked when inverted.  I tested it and it leaked my coffee. The top is okay as long as you keep the cup upright, and only ask it to prevent major spills.",neutral,mug
"The MagSlider has only ""OPEN"" or ""SHUT"" positions. It will not give you control over how much the slider opens. You have to adjust your coffee drinking preferences to that of the Mug! The slider is unable to adjust to your preferences.It only opens or shuts. In addition to this, the mug is also heavy, big and not easy to hold.The mug is very high quality solidly built. I just wish they give these two concerns a thought.",neutral,mug
Made of quality materials but has flaws since it is not leak proof.,neutral,mug

"The slide on the lid (magnetic) leaks. You would think that this would be a no-brainer design requirement. ""Need a lid that does not leak"". Apparently Yeti thought it was OK if the drinking slide leaked.Not for me.I have two other insulated, stainless vessels. One for coffee and one for water (when hiking). Neither leak at the lid. Might be OK for in-home use but since it leaks there is no way I am taking it in a vehicle. Also wondering what happens to the lid the first time it slips out of my hand and lands on the tile floor in the kitchen.",neutral,mug
The lid is to small,neutral,mug
"After hearing so much about Yeti, I took the plunge and purchased a 30oz rambler for the husband, this 20oz rambler for myself, and a mug.  I love the construction of the rambler.  I can put ice in a drink at bedtime and the next morning the ice is still there.  Put a room temp beverage in your Yeti, then put Yeti into the fridge, and the drink remains room temperature.  I couldn't be happier with the rambler.  That being said, the lid leaks, a lot.  I was quite surprised to have a leaking lid from a company of Yeti's reputation.I found out the hard way when my $300 Brahmin bag got filled with water from the leaking lid.  I checked the lid on my husband's, and it leaks too.  I was hoping to add drink and protein mixes, then shake, but it's not meant to be.  So 5* for the rambler and 1* for the lid.",neutral,mug
"I bought the all-stainless 20 ounce Yeti Rambler, and it is very nicely constructed, has a very good lid for sipping/drinking, and is incredibly easy to clean.  I use it only in the office, so do not care about any leakage.Two Big Negatives:  1) I am a tall man with medium hands, and this is a very big diameter mug to hold.  It should have been taller and thinner.  If you have smaller hands, I do not recommend this mug.  2)  It does not keep liquids nearly as hot as my Camelbak 20 ounce Chute or even the old Starbuck's/Contigo 16 ounce tumblers I have.  It is Okay if you want to drink everything within 30 minutes.Overall, I don't think it is worth the high price for this size Tumbler.",neutral,mug
Most important thing to know is this will not prevent spillage. Put it in a backpack and it was wet inside just from normal usage. I like the magnetic sliding cover and keeps drinks cold.,neutral,mug
                    The media could not be loaded.                 At first I didn’t want to believe the reviews but it’s all correct it still leaks when the lip is on and CLOSED. I wasted $30 on something I thought was great :/,neutral,mug
"So this thermos was such a disappointment. It wasn’t necessarily cheap either. I was expecting a YETI because it called itself a YETI. This thing doesn’t even keep liquid hot for three hours-Luke warm at best.. very dissatisfied on this purchase! Go with the Built brand if you’re shopping for a mug, I haven’t found anything better for the price so far..and it doesn’t ever let me down..",neutral,mug
"I loved my yeti and used it everyday but after 4 months everytime I drink, it leaks while I drink!! It's really annoying to take a sip and liquid is dripping down the side of the yeti. I thought it was just a defect on this one but my other yeti started to do it too. Now I have to drink through a straw everytime I use it. Really disappointing when I spent $30 and my $9 knock off one's don't have this issue.",neutral,mug
"I purchased a Yeti after multiple people raved about how efficient it is at keeping beverages cold/hot. I must say I am absolutely pleased with this feature. However, I am very disappointed at how the lid leaks. I placed my thermos in my lunch bag for easy transport. I arrived to work to find coffee spilt all inside my lunch bag from the coffee leaking from the lid. I thought it might have been because I overfilled it. However, the next day I filled it less and put it in my cupholder in my car. Coffee still leaked all on top of the lid during my drive. Not sure if my thermos was defected but very challenging to use as it constantly leaks.",neutral,mug
I was hoping for a cup that would stay hot or longer,neutral,mug
El producto tiene buena manufactura pero la tapa no sella completamente y se tira el líquido muy fácil.,neutral,mug
"For hot beverages I’m not sure this product is really any better then a cheap knock off version. I have a $10 tumbler just like this that keeps my beverages just as hot as this one. I do like the lid better though on the Yetti. It has an open and close lid that does not easily leak. Ultimately, I’m not sure this is really worth the $30 and you can probably find a comparable tumbler for a much cheaper price.",neutral,mug
"This cup doesn't keep drinks warm for as long as you'd expect when you are outdoors(at temps below 60 degrees fahrenheit) which was 50% of the reason I bought this product.  The slide mechanism on the lid allows liquid to leak out. It will leak out mostly when the cup is 95% full on any road that isn't smooth as glass. However it will leak out at any level over 60% if roads are rough, curvy, or if you have to stop suddenly. There are cheaper cups available that preform just as well as the YETI cup or better. I'd say 1/4 of the price of this cup is just for the YETI logo painted on the side(which does turn some heads from curious potential customers looking for info or an upgrade).  This cup does look nice and has a nice weight to it but isn't worth the $30 price tag.",neutral,mug
This cup developed a black residue inside and it cannot be cleaned.  I’ve had the cup for 6 months.,neutral,mug
I had my doubts but I bought one of these things because everyone I know that has one raves about it.  It works better than my gas station bought mug.  I would write a longer review but I have to go reheat my coffee.  And to do this (unlike my gas station mug) I need to pour the coffee out of the Yeti into a cup.  I have tried putting the Yeti in the microwave but after 2 minutes on high the coffee temp didn't seem to have changed at all.,neutral,mug
"Had this in my cart for 2 years. Couldn’t get myself to spend $30 on a coffee tumbler, but loved this cup! I finally really needed to replace my old one so  I did it. Would not recommend for coffee. Does not stay hot. After an hour it’s warm, but too cold. I haven’t tried iced drinks. My old $12 tumbler stayed hotter longer.",neutral,mug
"I wanted to love my Yeti Rambler, but it failed at the one most important thing I bought it for. Yes, it is well made, strong, attractive and keeps things hot/cold a really long time, but unfortunately the magslide top isn’t leakproof. I bought this to use on the go and be confident that if it got knocked over, it wouldn’t leak. Unfortunately, it fails that test.I know other reviewers mentioned that it’s not leakproof, but I made the mistake of seeing it a local store where the salesgirl assured me that magslide lids are indeed leakproof...should have done more research.I require something that’s easy to open/close with one hand even when you’re being bounced around in turbulence, and if it tips over, I can’t have it spilling all over my vehicle. Sadly, this Yeti isn’t that, and the price is high for just another insulated coffee cup.",neutral,mug
"I was hoping this would replace my aging Camelbak travel mug, but so far have been disappointed.  This mug is kinda fat which makes it difficult to hold and get in and out of a cup holder while driving.  The seal is not as tight as the Camelbak and the beverage does not stay hot as long.  I have stopped using it as a travel mug and only use it when I am at home and it is fine for that purpose.  Disappointed and will probably not purchase again.",neutral,mug

The lid leaks.  I would not buy another one.,neutral,mug
I just got and was so excited to find a American made product as I did some research and from what I read thats where it was made. That's mainly the reason I purchased it. 1st disappointment. It's NOT made in America. It was DESIGNED in Texas but made in China. I put it in a pocket in my backpack and the top leaked some. As to weather it keeps things hot or cold for extended periods of time that remains to be seen,neutral,mug
"This tumbler is very well-built and I like the magnetic opener on the top.  However, it's grossly too heavy and it's difficult to hold.  They make a handle for it but the handle doesn't allow the cup to fit in a cup-holder.  Buy something lighter and smaller.",neutral,mug
"I liked the look of the product, the mag slider and that it didn't sweat, however it definitely did not keep my beverage cold for an extended length of time. I have previously purchased other items at the store that kept my ice water colder longer. I did not expect for the ice to melt that fast. I had a cup years ago that contained the ice from the morning when I left for work to the evening when I returned from work and was amazing, however somehow this got misplaced. It was another brand.",neutral,mug
I found yeti to be way over rated I have similar products that cost very much less that work better. Yeti is far from spill proof. It keep thing cold for about the same time as the less expensive one. Not worth the extra cost. You are buying a name.,neutral,mug
"I adore Yeti products! I have several different tumblers. I ordered 5 from two different shippers and this one came without a magslider. I was giving them as gifts the following day so I washed one I already had to give with this tumbler. I just don't understand how quality checkers miss that! You cannot keep your drinks hot or cold if the lid cannot close. Normally I would give the ""leak proof"" section a 5/5 but gave it a 1/5 due to this mistake.",neutral,mug
Cup arrived with the missing magnetic part to the lid.,neutral,mug
"The two older models I have are my favorite. They don't leak, they don't spill and they are rugged. They work first time every time, for cold or hot drinks. But this new one doesn't seal properly. It leaks out of the little mouthpiece. And then I have to fuss with it over and over until finally, if I am lucky, I can get the little rubber foot to seal the mouth hole properly. It doesn't look defective, I can't see what the issue is -- I just know I have to test it and take the top off and reset the mechanism several times to get it to work.",neutral,mug
It functions well is keepIng coffee hot and in being spill proof. Cleaning the lid is pretty challenging as accessing the nooks and crannies is next to impossible. So I usually let it soak a while in warm soapy water and rinse well.But my complaint is the paint. Got this item for my wife because her favorite color is teal. Within a year of normal use and cleaning (NEVER ONCE out it in the dishwasher) the paint is coming off. Looks terrible. I probably would not buy another colored Contigo.,neutral,mug
"Good product except for one very important thing: evidently you must press and HOLD the autoseal button in order to keep drinking ""portal"" open in order to drink. IMO, it should be modified such that you do not have to maintain pressure on the autoseal button. It should just open and close.",neutral,mug
"Whether or not these thermal mugs are good or not good depends on what you want in a thermal mug. What I want is very not coffee for a very long time. We have a 1,600 mile drive ahead of us, so I tested this Contigo out. I pre-heated it with hot water, filled it with coffee, added sweetener and powdered milk and took a sip. Very hot. Then I screwed on the lid at 12:25 and headed to my hair appointment an hour's drive away. The coffee remained hot for the entire drive. I continued sipping at the salons but, by 2:30, the coffee had cooled considerably. One half hour later, it was Luke warm. So, only fairish heat retention. I also think the opening should be a tad wider. Hot liquid feels like a laser beam in your mouth because it is so concentrated.",neutral,mug
Not sure if this is a contigo knock off. Doesn’t keep hot beverages hot very long,neutral,mug
"Attractive travel mug. I haven't had any problems with cleaning it or it leaking. But I was initially surprised at how thin it is -- not much insulation. And sure enough, it doesn't keep coffee hot for long at all. But a year later I am also unhappy that the paint is chipping off, badly. I wouldn't buy this model again.",neutral,mug
Just be aware that you have to push and hold a button on the lid each time you take a sip.,neutral,mug
"When I saw in the bullet points that the product will keep beverages hot for 7 hours and cold for 18 hours, I thought I was getting a newer model, so I didn't balk at the higher price. When I received the product, It was the same 5 hours hot as the other lower-priced models. So, I feel a refund of $5.00 should be credited to my account to coincide with the average price of the 5-hour hot models.",neutral,mug
"I got this mug for its lid design. It is true that it doesn't leak and can't accidentally open. I've ruined a few backpacks with travel mugs opening up inside after being jostled around. My only complaint about the mug is that it doesn't retain heat as much as I would like. I usually drink half my coffee in the morning and save the other half for the afternoon, but with this mug the coffee is cold by 1 pm. It would be a perfect mug if it retained heat longer or if I planned to drink all my coffee in the morning.",neutral,mug
"16oz versionPros:  Good form factor, fits in cup holder, completely spill proof, relatively easy to clean, looks good, easy to drink from.Cons: Keeps hot liquids warm, not hot no more than 2 hours- not nearly long enough for me. My previous cup with a drinking hole in the top (easy to spill), kept hot liquids hot for over 5 hours!  Keeps iced liquids cold about 3 hours.There are better items on the market but it depends on what you really need.  I needed leakproof but the insulation level is not enough for me.",neutral,mug
"I bought this product on November 6, 2022 and here are my pros and cons after owning it for almost 1 month.Wide mouth is a big plus for easy to hand wash with brush. The lid is also easy to wash by hand although the push button mechanism I find a bit tricky to wash thoroughly; not the best design in my humble opinion. As for the rest of the mug, the outside is very sturdy and easy to hold. I really enjoy the one button function, that it is leak proof and fits perfect in my car cupholder. Lastly, I'm not impressed with heat retention. My coffee is cold in less than two hours. Now I checked the temperature when I pour hot coffee in my mug and registered 180°. I would expect for it to remain hot longer than two hours since its advertised to hold hot drinks for 9 hours. Not too happy with that con so that's why I gave it 3 stars.",neutral,mug
"I love the color and the size because it is perfect for smaller women's hands. However, it is uncomfortable to use because you have to hold it from the top to press the button to keep it open while you are sipping your hot drink making it bottom-heavy and uncomfortable in my hand and wrist. I like to hold my travel mugs in the middle of the mug, not at the tippy top. Also, my hot drinks do not stay hot for as long as it states.",neutral,mug
"The bottle, action, color etc all greatHowever specks of rust have appeared on the inner part that holds the liquid which very simply means material quality is not goodI have a bunch of Stanley products which have lasted for years with no trouble but this product line seems to be of inferior quality",neutral,mug
Preheated the 20oz mug with hot water. Then poured in hot  black (no cream) coffee. The coffee was luke warm after 2 hours. I believe the heat is lost through the top. Top is not insulated.,neutral,mug
"I purchased this just to add yet another thermos to my collection. I've been using the Zojirushi thermos's and I guess I just wanted to try a different brand. Unfortunately, the coffee did not stay hot all day. By the 3rd hour, the coffee started to get warm, and by the end of the day, the coffee just wasn't that good anymore.With Zojirushi, the coffee stays hot even well after an average 8 hour work day. One time, I even forgot I had made myself some coffee, and left the thermos at home. Upon returning home, then by the evening, realizing I had made coffee that morning, I decided to taste it, and the coffee was still hot. Not freshly brewed hot, but not exactly on the warm side either.Then you have this thermos, which only lasted for a few hours of staying hot :( I'll keep it though, it is quite a sturdy thermos and much easier to clean. Again, I'm probably just spoiled because of the other brand I've been using.Maybe I'll use this one for water.",neutral,mug
I wanted to love this mug so bad . I loved the color the texture and the way it felt holding it but Stanley needs to simplify the lid. Unfortunately the one I received leaked,neutral,mug
"It does NOT keep my coffee hot for 9 hours contrary to the claim. I heat this thing up with boiling hot water at bedtime then fill it up with fresh hot coffee.

"I haven’t tested it for how well it keeps stuff hot or cold.  It’s a thermos, I imagine it works well enough.  The button to open the spigot works, but it comes out a bit slower than I’d like. The metal frame gets very hot - such as if taken inside a sauna - and becomes too hot to handle very quickly.  No rubberized grip, which is quite obvious from the picture.  Over priced for what comes across as average quality.",neutral,mug
"I love this mug, I bought it a little over a week ago and have been using it every day. Today I noticed a chip in the exterior paint on the mug. I hand wash thing, so I don’t put it in the dishwasher. Not sure how it chipped, but considering I’ve only had it for a week, it’s quite disappointing. It’s also not like I bang it around and drop it, I take care of it nicely. I requested a replacement and Amazon is giving me one, but it’s still kinda annoying.As for the mug itself, it keeps things cold and hot nicely. I bought two separate ones, one white for water and this black one for coffee or hot drinks. It doesn’t leak at all like it advertises, but it does sometimes squeal from the pressure inside it.",neutral,mug
"*Update:After following up with Stanley on Facebook because I couldn't reach them any other way, they looked into my issue. They required more information than was asked in the warranty claim form. Specifically a number on the bottom of the mug which was now worn after a year of use. It was almost illegible but I sent them a picture of the bottom of the thermos for them to decide. After I provided the additional information, they approved my claim and will be sending out a replacement trigger action top. However, they are backordered (as is everything now) and I won't see this replacement top until mid November. I hope they send a green lid because it would match my thermos and be a direct replacement, but we'll see what I get. Keeping the 3 stars for now.I liked my thermos at first. I thought the trigger was nice and it kept my coffee hot from 6am until lunch time every day. I like how it fits in all standard cup holders. I always found the parts a little difficult to clean due to the cavities in the lid but it's not too bad. The main reason for the 3 stars is that the thermos started leaking a few weeks ago. It leaks from the button. If you fill the thermos above the little line and it builds pressure from the coffee inside, pressing the button causes hot coffee to fly out from the button...I contacted Stanley customer service, but nobody felt the need to respond. So customer service is non existent apparently.This isn't your daddy's thermos unfortunately. These are now inferior products. If their customer service ever decides to respond and make things right, I may change my review. You hate to see products with such an excellent track record not live up to the expectations.",neutral,mug
"In a attempt to improve on there product, just like every manufacture, their cup gets worst. When I bought my first Stanley cup 3 models ago it was great. Not only keeping my coffee hot but easy to take completely apart so it was easy to clean. It got damaged so I bought the next model. This one did not come completely apart and then wasn't as easy to clean. I lost that one and bought the current model. What a disappointment. They changed the way the rubber stopper piece is attached to  the lid and it keeps falling off. I don't know if they changed the way the lid goes together or not but the bottom half on mine keeps falling off into my coffee. There has to be a better cup made by a different manufacture out there somewhere and I am going to start looking for it. It is a shame because I have been using Stanley Thermos for 45 years but now I got to be looking for something else. STANLEY, what is the lesson here!!!

"It's a nice looking bottle. I like the easy press to sip function. I don't know what others are complaining about with the lid, old coffee stuck in crevices. You can take it all apart and rinse it well. Haven't had any residual smell or anything. Other than that, the product is sub par in it's ability to keep thing hot or cold. Which is it's MAIN purpose! You can see from my picture, I made fresh hot water from my Keurig and closed it off, untouched for 5 hours and the hot water became luke warm. Even with ice water. Within 3 or 4 hours, most of my ice all melted away. I have an insulated cup with NO LID on that holds ice overnight for more than 8 hrs! I'm going to keep it cause it's a nice size for carrying around and fits my kayak cup holder well. It'll keep my coffee warm long enough for the morning when I'm out fishing. I do drink coffee all day but I guess I'll just whip up a new batch as I dock and make lunch or camp. I'm thinking it may be the robust lid that's not allowing it to fully insulated. Nice idea but failed. Sorry I can't recommend this cup. I had an old Thermos from Walmart that kept my coffee hot for 8 hrs but lost it during a fishing trip and can't find it at Walmart anymore. ☹",neutral,mug

"I bought one of these several years ago and bought this one as a back-up.  When it arrived, I noticed that the sealing mechanism in the lid was made of different materials that the one I bought a year before.  It does not seal as tightly and will leak is it is shaken, or tilted on its' side. Not a lot of leakage but enough that I cannot put it in my backpack while commuting.Overall decent performance from a travel coffee cup but not what I expected from the Stanley group of products.",neutral,mug
"the trigger action is extremely stiff, overly so. you also must press it down the entire time you are drinking, there is no ability to keep the trigger open. so you can't hold the thing and drink from it, because you have to be pressing the trigger the entire time. positioning of the trigger is also opposite of the opening, so it is awkward to press the trigger down and drink at the same time. poor design.",neutral,mug
"I'm a big fan of Stanley and have 2 thermos' over 30 years old. bought this and found that with arthritis in my thumbs I was unable to open and keep it open without pain. also the grip area was a little large for my hand, perhaps a silicone band at that top, which would make it larger but also easier to hold.

"I needed something to replace  Camelback forge with a lid fail and no replacement available.  I’ve always had Contigos as well, And having tried the other two I’m going back for the maximal comfort in my hand and when sipping. As long as I tip a Contigo upside down and burp it before using it doesn’t spray or leak.The little well that forms when you close the sip hole on the Stanley really does collect enough coffee to annoyingly drip on you or make you feel compelled to lick it off to prevent staining clothing after every sip.  In addition it is very thin and narrow and the shape is just less comfortable in my hand but this may be a non-issue for others... The whole  top is just too narrow to comfortably sip from, and I get less coffee with each sip compared to either the Camelback or Contigo. I am replacing this after one day of use because I dislike it that much.  Add the fact that there is an inside piece to the lid assembly that can collect water and grow mold that you can never get in to clean or see and you have a fail.",neutral,mug
I bought this fir Mt husband's lunch box because it said leakproof and could be packaged (lunch box) well that didn't work he said it leaked out.

"I was a bit disappointed with this new version of the Stanley Classic One-Touch. I broke the lid on the one I bought in 2018 and could not find a replacement, so I bought this newer version. It is not like my original Stanley. The material is flexible and not as strong as the older version. The coffee only stays hot a couple of hours, while my old Stanley kept the coffee hot for 8-10 hours. The last straw was when the lid fell apart inside the mug while I was drinking. Definitely not the same quality as the previous version.",neutral,mug
"So, I purchased this thinking that it would:a) work at least as well as the original model, andb) give me a spare lid for my original model cup.I based this on all of the user reviews claiming it was oh so awesome and oh so much better that the original. Well, sorry to say the lid is pretty flimsy internally. It will quite obviously shatter or at least bind up if you use the 'heated dry' function on your dishwasher, so be careful with that. Secondly, the lid will not, and I mean truthfully will not, fit the original model mug. So, you are stuck without being able to find a replacement lid for your original OG stanley trigger mug by any other form than dealing with the web-forms on stanley's website. This was such a huge bummer for me.However, the new finishes look at least as good, sometimes better, than the original style green hammertone. I'm quite smitten with the black and the polar white coatings. The night or midnight blue coating is more akin to anodized finish than paint. All look sexy. However, plan on getting additional lids tout de suite when you order your mug... and no, these new lids will cannot be used in your otherwise identical original OG Stanley trigger mugs.",neutral,mug

Love the size and that it really is leakproof. However as a senior found it uncomfortable to hold the button at same time as drinking. to wash it you have to take apart the top that you have to carefully reattach so it does not drip. Also don’t like the fact that the second portion is made of plastic which doesn’t seem to be very durable. The mug does keep the coffee hot.,neutral,mug

"I've been trying different brands of travel thermos to keep coffee hot throughout the day. I had high hopes for this Stanley Classic Trigger Action Travel Mug. I like the trigger action lid--it is definitely leak proof; it's also easy to hold and to clean. The reason I gave it only three stars is that it does not keep my coffee hot for more than 3-4 hours. I'll continue my search for a true ""hot"" thermos.",neutral,mug
It's kinda of pain to clean the inside of the cap. You need a small bottle brush. If you drink coffee with milk you will get some residue accumulating in the cap.,neutral,mug
"Great cup, keeps coffee hot for a long time. Except the lid is horrible in every way. Terrible to clean, not even remotely leak proof, and is best served by being thrown away. If they had a normal lid with a little flip tab, then it would be perfect.",neutral,mug
"It keeps hot for hours but only if you keep it upright … if you put it in your bag horizontally and the liquid touches the upper plastic part, it immediately loses heat.",neutral,mug
"I'm quite impressed with how hot this thermos keeps my coffee. Three hours after filling its still almost too hot to drink. The problem is that you cannot get a good drink from the mug. Liquid king of dribbles out instead of pours. You can't get a good ""drink"" of coffee. Disappointing because the size and shape are perfect for my car cup holder - but I can't fight the spout while driving.",neutral,mug
"It's great in general but cleaning it (the top part that splits into 2) is a nightmare.  What a horrible design.  Makes me not want to use it much.  I just took it on a 5 week road trip across the country and back and it was great, except for cleaning it.* it DOES keep things hot a very long time* it doesn't leak* it's a good size* BUT it's super annoying to clean",neutral,mug
"Putting the cap on and getting it just right so it doesn't leak is not as easy as the older version. I always turn it sideways to make sure it doesn't leak well this time ""it squirted straight out"". Never had this problem with the other type of top where you disassembly to clean.I've only used Stanley so I know they're good products. I want the older version back.  Lol",neutral,mug
"First of all this has a great leak proof seal which I love so I can just throw it in my work bag without worrying. I was disappointed to find that they don’t hold the heat as well as I had expected them too, even when primed with boiling water first. They are alright but not great. One thing about all of these types of cups is that once you put coffee in the the flavor seems to soak up into the lid and anything else you use it for will have a slight coffee taste. I am very picky about flavors. They are pretty easy to clean because the lid breaks apart easily and you can scrub it down inside (still tastes slightly like coffee though). You do have to be sure to put it back together exactly right or it will end up leaking. I learned this the hard way. I have an older version of this that I really like (although I had to buy one for coffee and one for tea due to the flavor thing) so it was an easy decision to go with this brand again, although now I am not so sure.  I bought 2 of these and wish I had only purchased one first before deciding on the second one.",neutral,mug
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Right out of the package the bottle sounds like a “rainmaker.” Something is apparently damaged inside the walls of the bottle. Going to test it out but I will probably have to send it back because I really can’t be certain there’s not a weird leakage between the container portion and the inside of the wall of the cup. Not sure what in there but I probably don’t want to drink it.,neutral,mug
This is a great cup in all aspects except it does not fit under a coffee maker.,neutral,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 I love it, I bought 2 one for me ond one for the boyfriend. I just wish mine did not come with a dent & wobble..doesn't prevent it from keeping things hot so I didn't return.  Thought you should all know to inspect upon arrival..I waited a couple of weeks before I opened it and used.",neutral,mug
I gave another coffee mug as a Christmas present but it leaked really bad. Got this one as a replacement but unfortunately this one leaks too. Doesn’t leak as bad as the first one though. If you tilt on its side it does not leak but if you turn it upside down will start dripping. The person getting the gift said that was OK so I’m keeping it.,neutral,mug
Good travel thermos but leaked a little.,neutral,mug
"Update:The customer service people at Stanley contacted me and offered a replacement mug because of my Amazon review. I'm very impressed that they reached out to try to make me happy. Too few companies put this kind of effort into customer satisfaction nowadays. Kudos to Stanley. I'm changing my one-star review to a three-stars. To those of you considering buying this product, it's a five-star product if you can't detect the taste like I can. Based on all of the Amazon reviews, the odds are in your favor.My quest for the perfect travel mug continues. I don't understand how we as humans can engineer things that take us to other planets, but cannot properly engineer a travel mug. First, the good: The ergonomics are very good, heat retention is excellent. I filled it up with water that temped at 197 degrees, sealed it up, and waited one hour. The outside stayed cool to the touch the entire time. A good sign. After re-temping it, it had only lost 12 degrees. Ten hours later, it was still 120. Nice job Stanley. Now the bad, and the reason I only gave 1 star: The materials it is made from add a bad flavor to my hot beverages as if I were drinking my coffee from an inner tube. Please, Stanley corporation, can you tell me why you would choose to use materials that leach unsavory flavors into my coffee? Who is in charge of your quality control? Why would you mass produce a product designed to contain consumables that changes the flavor of them? I really enjoy the flavor of my morning coffee, but it is not possible with your product. Very disappointed.",neutral,mug
"Nice design and and it’s easy to drink out of but only fair at keeping my coffee hot. I like to sip the coffee throughout the day.  It was just lukewarm after 10-12 hours. To be fair, they do not claim that it will stay hot that long.  My real gripe and why I returned it was that it leaked. A lot. After it leaked the first time I put it in my pack I assumed I had done something wrong so after that I paid careful attention to snugging the lid down.  Yesterday all my papers were coffee-soaked when I got to work.  The mug was in my pack, not vertical but more upright than not. Other users rated it high for leak proofness (is that a word?) so perhaps mine was just defective.",neutral,mug
"I've always used Stanley, till this purchase.They kept the price the same, shortened the height by about 1.5 inches,looks like the same circumference but definitely not the same capacity as the older models.Still the same Stanley quality on the outside, but they changed the inside lid functions to allplastic now.Will not be buying another one.",neutral,mug

"Nice cup, but since its made it china will never buy another one.",neutral,mug
"Great product, just not for coffee if you have a Kuerig coffee maker, just an 1/8"" too tall with the top off.",neutral,mug
"I love Stanley products so I am very disappointed with this 20oz travel mug.  It does a great job of not leaking and keeping beverages hot for a long time.  However, like other reviews, the cap taints the taste of the drink with a terrible plastic taste.  I've tried following the guidance on the Stanley website regarding cleaning which did nothing and when I emailed Stanley they just said follow the FAQ.  After several months of hoping the taste would go away I'm tired of terrible tasting coffee (when I spend good money for quality coffee) and getting rid of this thing.",neutral,mug
"Definitely leak proof, but hard to clean the push-button lid. Doesn’t keep my coffee hot very long, and flops around in the standard sized cup holders in my car.",neutral,mug
Stanley is the best thermos on the market however my one thing I did not like with the spout that came with the lid I would recommend not buying that one it's sticking with a complete thermos it has a regular cup that,neutral,mug
"Llego dentro del plazo pero con detalles esteticos lamentables, rayaduras y peladuras en la pintura. Una pena porque es un gran producto.",neutral,mug
This is a light weight thermos made for use in the car cup holder. The lid is convenient enough to drink out of once you get used to it. Good for the price but not  what I was looking for.,neutral,mug
"Nice mug, but I found it too hard to open since I have a bit of arthritis in my fingers. Returned it.",neutral,mug
It does not keep content hot for long. Poured boiling water but after 4 hours it is meek warm. Not as good as  Zojirushi thermos.,neutral,mug
Kind of difficult to clean and the spring on the cover started to rust after a couple weeks. And sometimes it leaks. Would not recommend.,neutral,mug
Upon my second time taking a sip from this mug I depressed the button and it leaked coffee through the button area and down my work clothes.,neutral,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 The mug is beautiful! Looks solid, easy to hold , leaves no smell or taste in the drinks from the first use. It's leak proof and kind of easy to clean. The blue color is darker than it looks at Stanley official pictures. It's a pitty my bottle arrived full of scratches and bumps, and Amazon doesn't leave me a choice but to return the item. Unfortunately I will have to keep it like that as I live abroad and won't have the time to receive another product before my flight back home.",neutral,mug

"I bought several of these mugs; the main attraction was ""dishwasher safe."" Love it, except when the push button pops off, along with the return spring. Reassembling it is useless; it just keeps popping off. Stanley replaced several tops with no arguments (a good thing!) I presume the purpose of the return spring's is to insure that the seal around the actuator shaft keeps it seated properly, thus preventing leakage at the shaft. I found that if the return spring is removed. the button stays tight on the actuator shaft and the main spring at the bottom is strong enough to keep the internal body seal tight enough to keep it liquid tight. My suggestion is to omit the return spring. . The main spring pushing up against the actuator should put enough pressure against the actuator seal. This solution should keep the mug liquid tight without the button being pushed off.If the actuator seal isn't tight enough, over time, a stronger main spring may solve it.",neutral,mug
+ Push to drink system is very clever and useful.+ Keeps warm.+ looks good- It's very hard to clean the cap. Almost impossible without putting it on the dishwasher.- Material of the cap is very bad. Hard plastic. Especially inner part looks like something you don't want it to contact with your hot beverage.- There is a cheap metal spring that contacts to beverage and you had to clean which is impossible.,neutral,mug
"I bought this based on my experience with a Stanley thermos which keeps my coffee piping hot for hours. It stays hot for about an hour and then cools rapidly. By the time I take my lunch break, approximately 4 hours after filling the travel mug, my coffee is ice cold - not even a little warm.It’s leak proof and easy to clean, so those are a plus. Guess I’ll be using it for a cold water cup. Definitely disappointed.",neutral,mug
"It does keep your drink hot for hours!! It is leakproof. I love the how easily it comes apart to clean. However, I've had this thermos a few months and the color is already flaking off!!! Ot bubbles up in places all over and then burst and flakes off... kinda like a bad sunburn. I'm sure it will be fine after all the color flakes off. It's very annoying.",neutral,mug
"Ordered two. This color (blue) and green color.  The green one is working fine. This blue one I have problems with the button that opens the drink hole.  It's VERY hard to push in.  I have taken it apart several times to adjust it (you take apart for cleaning which is nice) and this seem to help loosen the button up for awhile. I finally just took the parts out that cover the button and the spring. The push button is still in place. The drink hole is now permanently open, but still closed slightly by some other part that still requires pushing the button  to open the drink hole all the way.  If the mug is knocked over, the contents will spill out.  However, this solved the problem of the hard to push button.  The green mug has been work flawlessly. Other than the button issue, the mug is well built and keeps items cold for hours. I do not use it for hot drinks.",neutral,mug
My second Stanley travel mug. This time had to deal with a wrap-around sticker. Okay if you can deal with the sticker removal.,neutral,mug
"In terms of keeping your hot beverage warm, this mug did phenomenal! However, despite daily washing using a bottle brush it has significant coffee stains - which makes me wonder if it's truly stainless steel. I've been using my hydroflask for just as long and it has no stains whatsoever.",neutral,mug
"This is such a great travel mug- BUT- the lid has a very funky taste it emits to whatever hot liquid being consumed. The taste never went away after a couple weeks of daily use & daily washings until we’ve just decided to stick the whole thing in the back of the cabinet. It’s unfortunate that the lid leeches. Tastes unhealthy and wish the company would fix it or offer a better material replacement lid.  On the positive- the lid is very easy to clean, liquid stays hot for many hours.",neutral,mug
"The thermos must have been dropped before being boxed up for shipping as the bottom edge is dented (so it wobbles while standing up right being filled) and there are minor scratches along the sides. It was nicely shipped with bubble wrap and window curtains, and there was no damage to the box it was shipped in. Better quality control to the items being shipped out is needed.",neutral,mug
"The item looks qualitative but not ergonomic.The button system is complicated and not easy to use.When you drink without the cover on, when you upright the bottle after sipping the water bounces back and splashes outside. I believe it is because of the rib on the structure.Overall not satisfied.",neutral,mug
"This is easy to hold, keeps beverages warm for several hours. From looking at the lid you would think it’s leak proof. Sadly it is not.",neutral,mug
I loved this travel mug. Unfortunately it gives this strange taste that ruins the flavor of coffee I’m drinking from it. I tried everything to get rid of the taste such as cleaning and boiling the lid. I wish it would’ve worked out because I really did love it,neutral,mug
"My first purchase off this mug was probably the single greatest thing I've bought.  Unfortunately, that was stolen and I had to get a replacement.  I could tell almost right away that this one wasn't as good.  The cap needed to be tightened much harder to get it to seal completely.  Then about a month in, the button popped off.  It went back on without too much trouble, but never seemed to fully seal as tightly.  I definitely wouldn't trust this on its side and certainly not in a bag.I wish I had returned it during the Amazon return window, now I have to go through the hassle of contacting the manufacturer and dealing with that.",neutral,mug
"WHY is it so hard to find a really great travel mug? I just don't understand - they're all vacuum sealed, which is great, but then they all have un-insulated plastic lids where all the heat escapes. It's like re-insulating your attic and leaving your front door open. all the insulation on Earth will do little good if it's capped off by a two-inch diameter piece of thin plastic. Is it truly impossible to create a coffee mug with an insulated lid? I'm no engineer, but I have to assume the laws of physics allow for the possibility. I can't count the number of different mugs I've tried. My old (OLD) Stanley mug was better than any of the last dozen I've tried.",neutral,mug
I really like this travel mug the only problem I have is there was a sticker on it that only the top layer cam off leaving a sticky residue rite where you put your hand.,neutral,mug
To complicated. The size is nice. It did keep the liquids warm. But there's a piece of plastic that is inside the lid and I've already lost that part - most likely during washing.,neutral,mug
It works great. Coffee is hot for quite a while. Sipping with the button and not leaving a little in the lid takes a few tries. Cleaning is easy I just wonder how long until something breaks,neutral,mug
I just received this and the button on the lid fell off!! All I did was wash the cup about to wash the lid and the button then fell into my sink. I just took it out of the box.Update feb 14. Amazon replaced my original cup I order this one so far has no issues. I’ll do another update about the review up the cup later thank you for amazing customer service.,neutral,mug

"We've had a couple of these and I was hoping the design would have gotten better.  Even though it stays cold and warm, the cleaning of the mouth piece is a pain.  And if you're not careful the little rubber piece on the mouth piece comes off and we lost one down the drain (hence why we've had a couple of them).  I probably won't buy this one again unless they come up with a better design.  Taking it apart and cleaning all of the interior pieces so you don't get mold is a pain in the butt.",neutral,mug

4 month review of daily use.The bottle appears durable and well made. The spout mechanism loosely locks into the lid and easily comes out of place. Once this happens the cup is wide open and you can not get the device out of your cup without drinking all of your joe or pouring it out.I would not buy again.,neutral,mug
"I want to love it but I can't. Unfortunately I had to return it.  I have a few stanley thermos and they work great keeping my beverage nice and warm. This mug was no different.  The problem I had with it was the sip button. It was placed to high on the cup. The feeling was very unnatural to me. I tried to get used to it, unfortunately I couldn't.  I felt I would rather have a more comfortable mug that wasn't as insulated. I have to say the top is easy to disassemble for cleaning. So if you can get over holding your mug at the very top than this mug should fit your needs.",neutral,mug
"Keeps coffee warm for several hours.  Lid had a plasticky taste that is slowly dissipating as I use it.  Seals well--have carried it in a butt pack with no leaking.UPDATE:  continues to keep coffee warm and doesn't leak when your not using it, even if upside down, HOWEVER, when I'm using it sometimes, coffee seems to get into the button mechanism that you push to open the drinking hole,, it then leaks out in the button area, runs around the sides of the cup, and dribbles down off the lower side (as you are drinking), this mug has its virtues, but dribbling coffee down one's chest at the office while wearing good clothes or while driving is a big problem.",neutral,mug
Did not keep coffee hot very long,neutral,mug
"Initially I thought I liked it but after a week of bring coffee to work, I found myself taking the cap off at work because it was so hot. I also thought the trigger, being on top, was too hard for my hand to use, so much that my hand would shake when I was drinking. I have it to my husband to use instead. He had no problem with the trigger, but he agreed with me that it was too good at insulated.",neutral,mug
"The metal portion is great and I like the old-school style. Unfortunately, the button on the lid keeps falling off for me. I've had 2 of these. The first one, the button started falling off on its own after a couple weeks of daily use (including a few dishwasher runs). Amazon replaced it. The second, I dropped on pavement from about 5 feet. The button fell off and I lost it. I wish I could find a replacement lid but it seems that Stanley only sells the entire package. I wrote their customer service group and have not had any replies in a couple months.",neutral,mug
I thought i could throw this in the side pocket on my backpack and leave in the trunk of my car on the way to work.  Unfortunately it leaks through the small opening on top of the lid.  It needs to stay completely upright in order not to leak.  Bought a Yeti to take to work.,neutral,mug
"Compared to the old model, the thermal performance of this new model is disappointing. The top of the bottle gets cold or hot depending on the temperature of what is inside, which implies it doesn't keep the heat as advertised. The hot tea that I poured in the morning cools down in less than 12 hours. I miss the old one I lost months ago, which had been just perfect.",neutral,mug
"6 hours and my coffee is still hot. Worth every penny. I can flip it upside down, shake it and not a drop comes out. This cup is amazing. As good as a yeti and not $300 for a tumbler.UPDATE... The small rubber seal WILL fall off and turn up missing rendering the sealing and ""spill proof"" part of this mug as useless.

"This mug or thermos is used for tea and coffee all the time. Did not expect the inside of the top piece to be as complicated as it was. constantly needs to be disassembled and cleaned. If not, good luck having good tasting coffee or tea, plus its disgusting. The inside of the top piece needs to be scrubbed with a bristle type brush so buyer beware if you want a click based top.

I was happy with it, it doesn't leak or cause dribble from the lid when drinking, and it keeps my coffee hot all morning, but I really wanted leak proof.  I don't know if I just got a faulty one or what.  My purse and paperwork in my purse was a soupy mess.",neutral,mug
This version is not as good as the original one I have. The only positive change is the inside of the lid. I love the fact that the inside part screws off so you can clean the lid better than the old version. Unfortunately the lid when you’re drinking out of it has a funny chemical like taste.,neutral,mug
"I like this mug.  Keeps coffee not and water cold for hours.  I bought this because my husband has had his for years with no issues.  Mine isn't of same quality, well at least not the lid.  I had the lid replaced once already because the push button kept falling off.  Replacement lid does the same when spring is attached.  It's still usable without spring but is not 100% leak proof now.",neutral,mug

"This keeps my beverage plenty hot, but to keep the lid from leaking, I have to tighten the lid as tight as I possibly can.  Then I can barely get the lid back off.  The lid is a pain in the ass, but the container is nice.  I like the size.  I like how long it keeps the beverage hot.",neutral,mug
I expected more from a Stanley. It’s a nice travel mug but drink fast. It doesn’t keep my coffee at all.,neutral,mug

"The husband enjoys....however, compared to older model that has spring action I'm fearful when cleaning and taking apart inside lid which is just a lining up the opening and twisting cap.",neutral,mug
"Really liked the 20 oz mug for the first 7 months, but it started leaking. I've tried to adjust the spring, checked the seals, etc, but the cap no longer creates the seal it did when new. Seems like an overcomplicated seal system -- with a more reliable cap, I'd rate higher. Have a cheaper Contigo mug of similar size that's a year older -- never leaks.",neutral,mug
The cap takes a few tries to screw on and the outer shell dents incredibly easy. Drop it once and it will never stand up straight again. The least they could do is strengthen up the bottom portion.,neutral,mug
"Good quality. Does not leak. Keeps coffee very hot. Only drawback is the drinking spout release. With my slightly arthritic thumbs, it takes two hands to drink. One to hold the thermos and the other to push the release. Cannot drive and drink at the same time or sip while eating.",neutral,mug
The mug is well made and looks rugged.  However the push button mechanism requires more force than my old hands can easily muster.  One hand operation is not possible for me.  For another person with stronger hands it would work fine.  I will pass it on to someone else.,neutral,mug
"I love Stanley projects, but the thermos mug is faulty. The press-in lever that releases liquid when drinking has broken twice. While I was able to fix it both times it broke, the fix is temporary (only a week). I will likely return it and try again.

"Eagerly anticipated using this mug for coffee, but each time I've tried, experienced a plastic-y smell/taste from the lid.The  coffee I'm filling it with is not boiling hot, so unsure why the lid is reacting this way.  Since the body is stainless, the reaction can only be coming from the plastic cap/lid.Will try again, but if this stink continues, this item will sadly be returned.",neutral,mug
Does it's job well. Keeps my drink hot or cold alllll day. Nearly all of it holds up to my expectations. Unfortunately the Stanley logo (and I have 4 of these) always seems to peel off the cup eventually. The lid is great but after extended use seems to get stuck a little bit.love the cup,neutral,mug
Not wild about the size of the top. I had a contigo before and it was a bit easier to drink from.,neutral,mug
"Works well but be careful when cleaning the lid. The little rubber stopper can come loose and down the drain it goes....Then you're hooped. It won't be leak proof anymore.

I use for coffee.  If you accidently turn over coffee spills out. Good as long as you don't turn over. My husband got me the smaller one but the tab broke. I can still use it. I just have to push in on the spring. Maybe the 20 oz was just a fluke. I use the smaller one.,neutral,mug

Pros: It keeps my coffe hot for a few hours and does not leak.Cons: 1) Requires too much pre work; you need to heat the inside with hot water for 5 minutes before use. 2) There a 4 parts of the lid that need to be dissembled in order to wash it properly. 3) Assembling the lid after washing is difficult and it does not always click when you close it.,neutral,mug

Cleaned every day, let it dry, vinegar, baking soda, boiling in water, even bleach, nothing removes that odor. Cleaning all the small areas inside the lid takes too much time and water. And like other people mention, handle doesn't line up with the opening so it feels awkward. 28$ for that? Thermos became terrible brand. 👎",neutral,mug

"My last coffee mug was it thermos E5 travel mug, and I’ve had it for 13 years. The rubber handle finally wore out and I used gorilla tape and an old cookie to wrap around the metal frame of the handle just so I could hold it comfortably. Finally, I figured it was time to get a new mug. Unfortunately they haven’t made that particular model for a few years, so I got the next generation, this mug. I like the widemouth for cleaning, Definitely easier than my previous mug. However the metal ring that the lid is made out of, well very nice because it’s stainless steel and therefore seems probably better for the environment and for me, does not feel good to drink out of. It is cold, which is the last thing I want to feel when I’m drinking hot coffee. I’ve tried to get used to it but I just can’t. I’m back to my old mug with my Jerry rigged handle. If anyone knows how I can get replacement parts for my old mug I would really love it. Thermos hasn’t responded…",neutral,mug
"The seal on a Thermos travel mug I’ve used for years failed and I ordered a new mug. The top on the new model is horrible. Moving the lever to the open position is more difficult particularly while driving. The top lacks sufficient recess so my nose which is average sized impedes the top when I tip it to drink, and the top requires disassembly to clean.  Very disappointed.",neutral,mug

"I love this mug. The shape is perfect, the handle is comfortable, it almost never leaks, and it keeps hot liquids hot for a very long time. Two things keep it from being perfect and they could easily be solved by the company.First is the finish. The paint on the outside of the mug peels off after a few months of normal use (see other reviews for pictures), dishwasher or not (don't put it in the dishwasher, ever!). The company that makes these needs to choose a more durable finish. There are plenty of coatings available to solve this problem. They need to solve it at this price point. Second, the stamped sheet metal handle mount is spot-welded to the body of the mug. Then, plastic handle screws in to this mount with a stainless steel screw. So far, so good. The spot welds that hold the handle mount to the body of the mug are not large enough. Over months of normal use, the handle mount fatigues and eventually falls off. This is also easily solvable by the company. A larger handle mount with larger spot welds is needed to make sure the welds don't yield under normal use and eventually fatigue.Fix these problems and it will be the perfect mug.",neutral,mug
"Had an older Thermos mug and the one seal on the twist off top finally gave way after years of use. Well guess what. I called Thermos and they no longer carry replacement parts for my old mug. Of course, they want you to buy a new one. By comparison, this new one is more of a pain to clean and you have to have it screwed on correctly otherwise it will leak. Does keep my coffee hot to warm all day. This mug is over-engineered!  Heh Thermos, keep it simple.",neutral,mug
"Keeps coffee hot all morning. Easy to open for drinking. The problem is that the lid has a numerous fully-removable pieces and the removable rubber seals that come off of each of those individual pieces. Thorough cleaning takes a long time since there are so many individual pieces, some of which are very small so it would be possible to lose it down the sink drain if you dropped it. Reassembly can be tricky too since you need to get the rubber seals properly seated again",neutral,mug
"Everything about it is good except the lid.  You need to take it apart to remove any buildup but after doing it a few times, it’ll no longer come apart w/o the use of pliers!  Very difficult to turn to remove otherwise.  So, for me the use of this Thermos is no more.  Waste of money.",neutral,mug
"Ordered one in ""cranberry"" and one in stainless, so the spouse and I could tell them apart. Stainless one cost (less than a dollar) more, sold and fulfilled by Amazon.  We received two brand spanking new cups, both in Cranberry.  I was going to return one but the spouse opened and used them before I could, so we have two red ones; he removed the Thermos label on his.  Cups work ok but a bit awkward to drink from without dribbling... also many fussy parts to clean.  They sure keep drinks hot a long time though!! We lament very much that the 14-oz handle cup by Thermos/Nissan has been discontinued, that was the best for drinking from, but only kept stuff hot for half as long.",neutral,mug
"I love this thermos mug.  I purchased it for my son to use while at college.  There was one issue that was a task for me.  I could not remove the labels on the front, the back and the bottom of this mug.  I soaked it in soapy water for days with very little results.  I then had to look on youtube on how to remove sticky labels.  After an hour of research on how to remove sticky labels, I did the following:  I used acetone (nail polish remover), there was still sticky residue on the mug and my fingers).  I  then used ""Krud Rutter"".  I worked hard on removing the labels; and after 1/2 hour, finally they came off.  I know ""thermos"" makes great products, but these sticky labels have much to be desired in removing them for good.",neutral,mug
"I bought this mug in July, 2018. It has worked pretty well keeping the hot tea hot for at least 6 hours. I encountered two problems.1. The middle insert within the handle fell off. Not sure how it broke.2. After a year and a half of use, rust has started to show up inside the mug in the bottom. I am buying another similar mug because it is a good product but it is very disappointing that there is rust inside the bug after only 1 1/2 year of use.I hope Thermos read this review and replace it for free.",neutral,mug
"When I cleaned the lid the whole thing popped apart, not just the three pieces that a supposed to come off.  I fiddled with it for ages trying to get it together.  Finally one last try and it all went into place. Now it will reside on an out of the way top shelf until I rehome it. I don’t consider this item to be Senior friendly.  It is too difficult to open. Cleaning and reassembly is just too time consuming and awkward.",neutral,mug

WHY ARE THERE STICKERS ON THE ACTUAL MUG, WHY! I already know that it keeps stuff cold for 1,000 hours. I don't need to be reminded on the mug again. It's just poor packaging. It seems to just be the Silver one. I bought the black one for my girlfriend and her stickers came right off.It's just unnecessary and it ruins the mug, I've already scratched it a lot just trying to get the sticky stuff off.",neutral,mug
"I would give this mug 5 stars however, I can barely get the lid off even in the open position.  When there is hot liquid inside the mug, the heat builds up a seal.  Even when I change it from closed to open position, the vacuum seal does not release.  I have to wait a few hours to take the lid off again once the beverage cools.",neutral,mug
"Keeps my coffee warm for a long time.  Does not leak when the lid is closed.

Terrible for the last, all important, 1/4.",neutral,mug
I bought this Mug to replace my old one. The old one I had for two years was black and just like most of people had issues with paint pilling off.  It was the only reason I had to buy a new one.

It would be great if there'd be some instructions around how to open it, in case the vaccum is holding it tight the first time.. It would be more better if the lid and mug can be kept opened as 2pcs.",neutral,mug
"The travel mug keeps the coffee hot for hours. We had some trouble on a driving trip. The open and close words don't line up with the close mechanism. We put the mug in a bag with other stuff.

"The thermos works great BUT... When I opened the packaging, it took me over an hour and a lot of elbow grease to scrub off the nasty adhesive that the product labeling left on the sides of the mug. Almost returned it for that sole reason if it wasn't for the industrial strength Goo-Gone I bought the other day.. Goo-Gone is the real one that deserves the 5 stars in this situation.",neutral,mug

"When I first got this mug I was pretty happy with it. It does keep drinks hot or cold for a couple of hours at least.It had the narrow base which means it fits into drink holders in the car, which was essential for me. The top had kind of a fun way of opening and closing it- you spin a knob in the center of the mouth of the cup, and it cycles through two open and two closed phases per one complete revolution (90° per cycle).Inside the lid there is a disc and a silicone seal and in the open position the disc drops down away from the seal and in the closed position it this comes back up against the seal and seems to prevent leaks pretty much 100% of the time.Unlike most cups when it's open you can drink from from any side of the mug, rather than just one near a small opening.In the open position you don't need to really worry about getting a huge glug of a hot beverage as it really slows down the rate at which it can come out of the mug, which I appreciate.At first it was not evident how you could clean the mechanism for the lid, but after a little experimentation I found that a nut in the center of the bottom could be rotated off counterclockwise and that would allow you to remove the disc.As time went on however I noticed a couple of issues.  First the letters that indicate whether it's open or closed to drink, wear off. They are painted on in silver, but that silver paint wears off after a couple of washes.Also, I've noticed that the feel of the open and close mechanism has become less distinct over time. It's almost as if something is wearing down, so you don't get the positive kind of snap sensation when the lid closes or opens internally. Most of the time I didn't really even have to look at the letters on top saying whether it was open or closed, I could just do it by feel, but now that ability is kind of going away as you kind of have to fish around with some uncertainty to determine whether you've gone 90° to an open position or closed position.I think this travel mug is a little pricey for what you get, but it does have a few decent features.",neutral,mug
Absolute best for keeping coffee hot. Absolute worst for the finish that comes off after few washes. Way too expensive for this.,neutral,mug
The rubber stoppers are a problem!!!  Very aggravating because it’s hard to put back after washing…,neutral,mug
I got this for my husband for Christmas. It has only been 2.5 months and the handle has come apart. The piece popped out and doesn’t go back in completely. Not very happy that something is already wrong with it. We have only hand washed it and this shouldn’t happen.,neutral,mug
"I really love a lot of features of this mug...the handle, the lid style, etc. but expected more durability from the Thermos brand. I did wash this in the top rack of my dishwasher, but it did say that it was dishwasher safe. However, after only a few uses, the paint peeled around the top area. I contacted Thermos because it does have a 5-year warranty, so sent them a pic and they sent me a replacement. I requested a stainless steel one if possible, so that paint wouldn't peel and received it within 10 days of contacting them. Very pleased with the customer service by Thermos and my replacement, but do wish they had better quality from the get-go on the painted mug. So, would recommend the stainless version vs choosing a painted/colored one.",neutral,mug

"I’ve purchased these for probably the past ten years. They use to be great. Very durable, leak proof and kept heat great. But they don’t seem durable any more. Mostly in the handle. The cover to the handle screw pops off much easier and I dropped this cup once and then handle completely detached off the cup to where it couldn’t be fixed. My old ones I use to drop them and they’d ding up a bit but never break. Just seems weaker than they use to.",neutral,mug
This is my second Thermos coffee mug. I loved the first one and had no problems until I left it behind on a trip. When I got this cuo and put the lid on the first time I noticed thed the holes for sipping went past 90 degrees from the handle. This makes it very awkward when drinking. If you loosen it it leaks. I am very disappointed,neutral,mug
"I do not usually write reviews. However this product warranted a comment. The thermos is very good at retaining the temperature of hot liquids. However, it is quite difficult to get the cap to “seat” appropriately. Every day I need to struggle with the assembly. Ultimately, the cap can be screwed into the thermos. However, this should not be difficult. It should be easy to screw the cap on and off. I bought a “Thermos”  brand insulated cup due to the brand-name. Big mistake.

"This doesn’t keep hot drinks hot for as long as it states, I’d give it a 2-3 hours.  The cap twists on funny so wherever you choose to drink from it’s an awkward angle of where you hold the handle.

Basic design is reasonably well engineered - but with previously noted drawbacks from other reviews. Two improvements would make this a really good travel mug. First the rubber seal and channel it sits in is inadequate. Rubber seal easily comes out of channel and if not noticed when screwing lid on a leak is guaranteed !  A  larger seal and channel would elevate this situation. Also the opening where liquid is dispensed has an elevated lip on the inside. This causes you to have to really tip the mug to get liquid out. That area should be recessed to eliminate this situation.,neutral,mug
"As with previous versions of Contigo insulated mugs, this one will keep drinks HOT/COLD for extended periods. But unlike previous versions this one has two flaws.1: previous versions have a trigger to open the mouth opening as well as a lock to prevent opening accidentally. This new on has no trigger, it is either locked open or locked closed.2: the ""mouth"" of the new mug is recessed and wide, witch makes it difficult to get a good seal (when drinking) which allows the liquid to ""dribble"" out the sides.",neutral,mug
"I have been through so many of these cups, I was careful to read everything about it as well as all the reviews.  Cup is sturdy and keeps my coffee hot ALL day.  The sip hole is a little on the small side, I like bigger sips. I have had it since Christmas and now the inner rubber seal in the lid has come out and is impossible to get back into just the right place. So the cup leaks. I am drinking now without the lid on.  Not good.",neutral,mug
"The button seal for the pour hole is easy to remove, clean and install.  The same can not be said for the cup rim to cap seal.  Easy to remove and clean, BUT very difficult to install correctly. Get it in wrong and it will leak all over your  shirt. These do keep beverages cold or hot for a long period.  These are difficult to open with one hand to take a drink, need to trim the small tab the holds the ""snapseal"" closed.  Don't place these in dishwasher, the colored coating will start to come off much faster than hand washing.",neutral,mug
I bought this cup as a cheaper alternative from their push button cups. I wish I would have paid a little extra for the button.This cup seals up nicely but is a little bit of a pain to open. Not too hard but again I think I was spoiled with their push button cups.The cup holds the heat and the cold depending on the drink choice. Doesn’t leak but found myself not closing it up as much due to the difficulty to pop the seal.All comes down to comfort to me. When you throw the lids in the dishwasher they all get washed equally. If handwashing was your thing than this cup would we a much easier lid for you to clean.Great looking cup though,neutral,mug
"The space on the top of the cup (and inside of the lid) with threads on them are too short.  Combined with widely spaced and ""shallow"" grooves, it's easy to cross-thread the top.  If you're not aware of this, the liquid will leak out the sides of the lid.Trying to drink liquid through the top is quite a chore (and done more easily if you remove the lid entirely).  The drinking hole is far too small to get a decent amount of liquid through.  Especially given that, when open, the ball seal inside the lid fits so close to the drinking hole that it still impedes the flow.I ended up enlarging the hole with a drill bit.  Still, it's not easy to drink out of, and way too much work to get a decent seal between the mug and the lid.I bought my GF a pair of Contigo AutoSeal mugs for Xmas.  Those are a charm compared to this one.  Given that the AutoSeal are the same price, next time the decision will be a no-brainer for me: stay away from the dreaded SnapSeal.",neutral,mug
"It works, sort of. I had their AUTOSEAL Travel Mug for about two months and it worked better and kept the contents hotter/colder than this model. It was more of pain to clean, but I liked it better. Then I left it in Canada where it remains today alone and lost in Gravenhurst. This model is easier to clean and does an adequate job, but the big hassle is getting the lid seal pried up. Yikes! That thing is one sticky bear. Maybe it will ease up with time and usage, but after a few weeks it still takes both hands to pry up the release. The flip side is once you have it sealed, nothing will come out and damage your laptop or keyboard etc etc. It is definitely shut tight. I also liked the rubberized gripper around the middle. Better temp holding and easier opening would make it a five star unit for sure.",neutral,mug
"These Contigo Travel Mugs are a hit or miss item. I purchased the Gunmetal version and love it. The lid seats well and the plug (that opens to drink your beverage) opens enough to sip hot coffee without burning my lip and keeps my coffee warm/hot for hours. I purchased a second Contigo Travel Mug, shortly after my first, for a family member and it had issues that some of the others have mentioned. It's very hard to seat the lid right, to prevent leakage and the plug does not clear the lid far enough, so as not to burn your lip when sipping. I also noticed on the underside of both lids.... they were constructed differently. So, I'm thinking there's a revised/newer version that's being implemented with perhaps the older design that may have had issues. The second Mug I purchased and the one with issues was the Violet one. Just my personal thoughts and experience with this particular Travel Mug. I guess you could say, I'm pleased, yet disappointed at the same time.",neutral,mug
"I like the mug. The liquids stays hot but not even close to the time they say it stays hot for. It is absolutely leak proof. That is the one thing that is really on point. I had an entire mug full of coffee which I placed into my lunch bag. I opened the bag and the mug was upside down; not sideways. No a drop came out. Now, the cleaning will need to be done will a special brush or sponge attached to a handle. No human fingers are long enough to get to the bottom. The biggest pain about this mug: You can leave yourself about an extra 2-4 minutes each day set aside for putting the lid on. The threads are close to impossible to line up and there are no indication markings to help initiate it.",neutral,mug
I’ve purchased at least a half dozen Contigo tumblers over the last three years. The quality has gone down. The lock switch does not work smoothly and “seal” is not as tight as older models. Older units would even retain carbonation,neutral,mug
"This is a good looking travel mug, it keeps coffee hot for a long time. The downside for me was the design of the drinking area.

Other than this, it's a nice cup.",neutral,mug

I’ve been very happy with Contigo snap and seal mugs and have several where the drink lid is flat.This specific Contigo mug version overall is good except the mouth piece you drink from is really awkward for drinking hot coffee. It’s almost like you need to slurp to drink.Maybe I’m crazy but that’s my feedback.I ended up keeping it and it’s sitting in my cabinet as a spare mug. I’m sticking with my original Contigo flat top version which I’ve been happy with for many years.,neutral,mug
I bought this mug having had one before. But i used this one for the first time and it leaked all down the front of my suit on my way out the door to work. I tried to contact the seller to get another cap but no one contacted me back.,neutral,mug
"Not a fan of the lid design on this one - you pop the valve up, and then push it closed when done. I much prefer their old design which had a spring operated button on the side.  With this one, when I pop it open, I usually get sprayed in the face with hot coffee (or papers on my desk end up getting rained on with coffee droplets).

Cup didn’t last more than 2 months before it started leaking. The rubber seal becomes lose and won’t remain on lid.Bought another and the same thing happened in less than a month. Got coffee on my white uniform shirt.  I guess I didn’t learn the first time. Don’t buy,neutral,mug

Keeps my coffee hot.  Too hot for my morning commute.  The real problem with this cup is the lip is not ergonomically designed to flow smoothly.  I had to awkwardly slurp from it and every sip I felt like I was spilling some.  I just take the lid off and drink without it.  Kind of defeats the purpose.If you want to save one cup of coffee all day rather than enjoying it in the morning than this cup is for you.,neutral,mug
"Well, not exactly leak proof and occasionally not better than a dribble glass.  The lip is also designed in such a way that that too is prone to liquid leaking all over your shirt",neutral,mug

"It keeps the product warm, but if you are not really careful, it leaks...onto your dress shirt on the way to work. Need I say anymore on the level of irritation with that? I am not wild about the drinking hole/spout. The drink tends to either rush out, or be difficult because of vapor locks. I have had many commuter cups over the past 35-ish years, this one is in the middle of the road.",neutral,mug
I just got these this morning… so have not use them yet… but I have a WARNING for anyone who buys both the 20 oz. and the 16 oz. sizes. There is a fraction of a mm difference in size. The lids are not interchangeable.  You cannot tell until one leaks it is the wrong size. Luckily I got gunmetal for the 16 and cranberry for the 20. The lids are color coded for the color you choose. If you bought all the same color for both sizes you might have a real problem when the lid leaks all over your clothes.,neutral,mug

"A very handsome travel mug! It keeps my coffee hot, especially if you keep the vent closed when not drinking from it.However, it’s almost impossible to screw the lid on, even when you know the starting point of the 2 sets of threads (vent aligned with “Contigo” at the bottom of the mug.

Not easy to drink from.,neutral,mug
Keeps my drinks cold and hot like other Contigos but it's a pain opening the top because it's way too tight. I have to use one hand to hold it and the other hand to pop it open to take a sip. I also sometimes have to hold it a distance so no liquid sprays on me when I do pop it open. I was hoping with time it would get easier but no luck.,neutral,mug
Dislike the seal in it leaks it is to big not a tight fit!!,neutral,mug

"If milk falls into the crack between container and rubber (for hand grip), it starts to stink.  Even after you have taken the rubber off and cleaned it properly, the smell does not go away.

I previously had a Contigo in a similar design. I needed a new one to take coffee in to work.

The design is what I wanted but it’s a no for me.,neutral,mug
"I've had mine for over 3 years and it is now time to replace it. The rubber hand grip had to be removed after the first week, as it kept riding up and was annoying. The gasket no longer lines up/seals the hole, so it will leak if tipped on its side. The most annoying thing is that the lid will occasionally leak from the bottom edge, dibbling you with water (this happened after about a year). It really will keep a drink hot/warm for a long time though, only reason I haven't replaced it sooner.",neutral,mug
The cup is well made and keeps my coffee HOT... as promised.  the drawback for me is I can’t get enough coffee in each sip.  the opening is restricted by the seal gadget.  I only get a tiny sip instead of a gulp. You have to really tilt it far up to get a sip. I find myself taking the lid off to drink.  it is a shame cause it is a great cup.  but just not working for me,neutral,mug
"Pros:-Keeps water hot for a while.-Mostly leak-proof (It has leaked in my bag, I think when pressure builds up from steam the cap loosens slightly and that can cause a leak.)Cons:-Not very comfortable to drink out of this lid. The hole where the liquid comes out is very small - easy to burn your mouth. I usually just drink without the lid.-The drink hole is very difficult to open. I have to use two hands to open it.",neutral,mug
Great little cup other than it dissipates heat pretty quick.,neutral,mug
"It broke as a result of a 3 foot fall.  Several previous falls, directly onto the bottom, dented the bottom and caused the mug to sit more and more wobbly.  Is a pricier mug more durable?  I don't know.  Maybe it's better to own several cheapo mugs.",neutral,mug

"I do not have much experience with ""travel"" thermo mugs, this is my first.  I don't have a problem ""burning my upper lip"" with this as other reviewers posted.  I do however notice a ""metallic"" taste when I drink from this.  I do not know if that is just a normal thing for these?  (since this is my first one)  I've drank my morning coffee and now I am drinking Pink Lemonade.. metallic taste with both.  Yes, I did wash it out really good before I used it.  The first day I used it, I filled it about 3/4 the way through, it seemed to keep my coffee ""warm"" 4 hours later, not much longer.  I'm assuming my coffee wasn't HOT HOT to begin with.  The next day I filled it half way, it did not keep my coffee warm for as long.  The one good thing I notice, is it does not lead.  I shook my lemonade in it and the top stayed on, lid stayed closed, no leaks.",neutral,mug

I have an old Contigo mug and it was time for a new one.  I read the reviews and purchased this one. It did not keep the coffee hot at all.  The hole for drinking the coffee makes a puddle and dribbles all over .  Will be sending it back or going in the trash .  What a waste of money.,neutral,mug

I expected it the have the same ability as my Contigo cold drink travel mug, which maintains the ice and cold drink beyond the 24hr period.  However,  the hot drink travel mug did not meet my expectation of maintaining the beverage heat.  At 3 hrs it is warm, still enjoyable, just not hot.  The lid can leak; therefore it is advisable to use the secondary closure just in case the mug tips over.",neutral,mug
"After a few months of use, the autoseal starts to fail. Mug parts are not designed for taking apart, thus impossible to clean properly, which means that after some time it becomes impossible to keep it hygienic",neutral,mug
Pros:Doesn't leak.Rubberized exterior makes for non-slip grip.Cons:Difficult to clean thoroughly.Can't drink to the last drop - the lid extends above the drinking hole so some liquid always runs past the hole when you tip it up.Does not stay hot long enough - this was the biggest issue and what led me to return it.,neutral,mug
"I saw the TV ads for these and decided to try one (also, it was on sale ;-). It appears to be as leakproof as advertised. I don't commute by subway, and I don't carry my travel mug around as I work, so I can't comment on durability in those situations. I mostly use it in the car, where it functions pretty well and hasn't leaked a drop. Today I left it in the car while I took my dog to the vet. After an hour in a 20 degree car, my coffee was still a little above lukewarm. That's not as good as my trusty old Aladdin thermos, but it's not unreasonable. If you look at this mug, it doesn't have thick double walls like a thermos or thermal carafe, so I think it does about as well as you might expect.As for appearance and construction, it feels and looks great. The top is made of fairly hard plastic and looks like it would crack if hit. In general, the leakproof top seems much more complex than a common cheap travel mug ... it works well, but does more parts equate to less durability? For my automotive use, I'm sure it'll be fine. In a more active environment I'd probably look for something less expensive or more seemingly built to withstand impact or mishap.And that's really the bottom line, I think ... given the great look and feel, good performance, and expectation of questionable durability, how much would I be willing pay for one of these? I bought mine on a super-duper Lightning Special Ultra Discount, or something like that. So I paid about half of Contigo's suggested retail price ... and to be honest, that's about what I think it's worth. Be patient and wait for these to go on sale.",neutral,mug
"Packaging:-The packaging was horrible, I ordered two Contigo mugs and they only put the items in a cardboard box. When I received and shake the box, the mugs can hit each other. Mugs could be covered with bubble pack. Hopefully there was no damage on the items. That is why my overall rate is 3/5.Pros:-The product quality is awesome. You can easily grip it and the mug has rubber part below, so you can put the mug on any surface with no hesitate, it won’t bang.-I experienced a filter coffee with it for the first time and two hours later, it was still hot.-Its diameter is approximately 7 cm. I hope it can fit with most car’s cup holder.-The rubber material feels really good, it looks long lasting.Cons:-The press button is placed on the cap but this part can a little bit hot when you drink hot beverage.-You may not easily get used to drink from the mug. It is a little bit challenging. I would prefer warm beverages for first try instead of hot drinks.-The cap has a locking part on the part. You need to turn that part about 45 degrees and pull to disassemble for cleaning. It is a little bit challenging.",neutral,mug
Looking for something that would work as well but is the no longer made by OXO thermal coffee mugs.  Husband tried the mug out and says it's not near the quality of his old thermal mugs.

This thing is a beauty and that’s it…it doesn’t keep my coffees warm for at least two hours…but it does keep my iced drinks cold for 6 plus hours…I bought it in August now I have to buy a new one again and Contigo thermos’ usually last a long time…definitely not worth $25 maybe $10…,neutral,mug

"I've loved the Contigo Auto Seal drink containers for years because they don't leak and I can pick up and drink with one hand.  The containers last forever (except a few that were painted metal and the color scratched and wore off eventually, just cosmetic).  However, I was sorry that I ordered this particular container because I don't care for the textured grip feature - it seems to collect anything you might have on your hand and is difficult to keep clean (must use a scrub brush).  The sliding cover on the top doesn't impress me as it is difficult to keep the mechanism under it clean.  Also, I often drink iced tea and the tea puddles around the drinking hole, stains and looks nasty.  I didn't think about the lighter color being an issue as my other containers have black tops.  So, yes to Contigo Auto Seal containers, just wouldn't recommend this particular one.",neutral,mug

"I've had this  for a year now and have thought it to be a fine coffee mug in most ways.  I purchased this style in the hope that it would make it easy for my arthritic hands to open and close the lid.  All went as expected until a couple of months ago when the grip began to slip.  Now it isn't really better than having no grip at all.  I don't believe I should buy another of this particular brand or style if after one year it no longer serves its purpose.  I expected it to last much longer.  I might try contacting Contigo to see if they will help out.  If so, I'll come back here and make a note of it.  Mark",neutral,mug
"For some reason compared to two other Contigo mugs I’ve had in the past, this has issues keeping liquids hot. The Autoseal mechanism is constantly improving (my coworker has another variant slightly different) and this is the easiest to clean that I’ve had. This particular model with the rubber grip has a smaller lid (with the extra twist lock cap) and it is a little more awkward to drink from (hard to explain but it is a shorter and steeper area from which you drink). Also some residual liquid can get trapped above the seal mechanism and drip if you are not careful to let it completely drain before closing the mechanism. This extra liquid can get trapped beneath the twist cap and “leak” but technically it is not leaking from inside.  If I were to repurchase I would get the normal all metal body with the wider lid.",neutral,mug
"As a fan of Contigo autoseal mugs, I was hoping for more from this mug.  I am looking to upgrade my go-to mug for the past several years the Contigo AUTOSEAL West Loop Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Travel Mug with Easy Clean Lid, 20oz, Stainless Steel.  I love this mug but need a non-skid coating on the bottom.  I next tried the Contigo Autoseal Aria Vacuum Insulated Stainless Steel Travel Mug, 20-Ounce, Charcoal but the lid does not allow for easy cleaning.  So I moved down a size to this one.On the surface it checked almost all of the boxes I was looking for: non-slip grip and bottom sleeve (my #1 priority), easy to clean top, and enough heat retention (missing the 20 oz size).  The problem I have with this mug is that it takes forever to get any liquid out of it, like 30-45 sec for a sip.  I cannot wait that long for my coffee, especially not while driving.  If the put the west loop lid on this cup I would gladly sacrifice the 4 oz of coffee but that lid doesn't quite fit properly on this mug.",neutral,mug

"Contigo is a quality product.  What I like about this over the West Loop is the bottom where you have the ""plastic"" piece that would keep the painted finish from chipping.  I actually got the stainless in this model because of the chipping paint issue--always hand washed & not rough treatment.  I do NOT like the design of this lid--it has a littlw reservoir where coffee collects & if you're not paying attention, it will be on your shirt!  Ugh!  Love wearing coffee!  Next you have to twist the lid to unlock.  Be careful to make sure the lid is still tightened to the base since you're twisting in the ""off"" direction.  WAY too much to think about to have a drink of LUKEWARM coffee.  These mugs do not keep your drink hot for more than an hour.  I even heat mine up hotter than drinking temp before putting in the mug & have had the mug sitting with hot water for an hour before that.  Hey, they don't leak in your bag sideways or upside down and they look nice.  Just wish they were more insulated.",neutral,mug

When nap time comes the coffee is still hot!...That said...There are some downsides... I clean my mig every day but still it smells like yuck (specifically the lid).  The small spaces that don't come apart but do trap water  are causing the problem and there is no solution shy of soaking it in bleach which will only make the lid smell like bleach instead of moldy/mildew.  Sigh... time to continue the search for an easy to clean non smelly vacuum sealed container.... i had high hopes for this one but after only 6 months of use its showing its self not to be all it's advertised to be. K also the grip is coming off and watter gets trapped in there too... feels grose and a bit scary bc there is no way for that water to dry...just constantly moist and well that =mildew over time,neutral,mug
"This is not a great mug. No matter what, things leak through the odd mechanism on top. Lid is not that easy to clean. The flow rate through the mouth is weak. Despite all the positive reviews, this wasn't for me.",neutral,mug
It's a decent cup. It doesn't keep your drink hot or cold for anywhere near 12 hours but it is still useful.,neutral,mug
"Love this mug VERY MUCH but after awhile the top rubber seal to keep it being spill proof expands so that very little liquid flows out when you try to drink from it.  Can't seem to find that Contigo has fixed this problem or has a way to purchase a new rubber stopper that works properly.  I don't want to throw out the mug just because of that little rubber stopper, they really need to fix this problem.",neutral,mug
"The product is okay...You get what you paid for. It appears to be well-constructed and durable (although the preventative spout blocker) is a bit loose. The product description says that it keeps liquids hot for 5-hours....This is absolutely not the case. I enjoy a cup of coffee at work that I prepare at home before leaving the house. I drink the coffee about 60-90 minutes after arriving to work. The coffee is quite warm but nowhere near the ""hot"" that I was expecting. It could be that my expectations were a bit high for a mug that I paid less than $20.00 for....But the reviews were indicating that it was rather efficient at keeping liquids hot. Overall, the mug isn't terribly bad...it doesn't spill, it seems rather easy to clean and it keeps me caffeinated.",neutral,mug
"I've had this travel mug for about six months now.  It keeps coffee at a drinkable temp for 2-3 hours.  The lid disassembles easily for cleaning,  and it is easy to drink from.My main complaint is the fact that coffee frequently gets into the ""groove"" on the side of the lid that the cover rotates in.  Then, the next time you lift the cup, you get a SMALL splash of coffee against your bottom lip.  To me, this is annoying as hell.  I've finally just removed the lid cover and this issue occurs much less frequently.I would not purchase this particular model again.",neutral,mug
As noted,neutral,mug
"I bought this for my 9 year old who loves icy cold water and drinks a lot at school.  (we had been using the 12oz kid contigos).  Well, she dropped it the first day and cracked the cover on the top.  I had to duct tape to fix it so it could still be used.  It continued to fall off lunch room table making me realize the base was not as balanced as other Contigos.  After a few more drops, the top cover has many more cracks and I am only hoping contigo will give/sell me a replacement.  It is great at keeping things cold and the top is a great concept.  For adults who don't drop it, I say go for it.  For a school kid, not so much.  And I do realize that BPF-free plastic is more fragile, probably the reason the top is easily cracked.",neutral,mug
"I bought this product for a couple of reasons.  I liked the rubberized sleeve and base, as well as the claim that it was leak free. The latter is NOT true. It wasn't constant, but just often enough to catch me off guard and stain my clothes.",neutral,mug
"I love the feel and design of this mug. It is very easy to clean, and so far it is leak proof. Additionally, I like the clean guard lid and cover. However, the hole in the lid needs to be a lot bigger. I don't particularly like the feeling of drinking my coffee out of a sippy cup. Secondly, it does NOT keep the coffee hot for hours as claimed. However, it will keep your coffee hot for a few hours, and  at least warm and drinkable for most of day. However, it does seem to be retaining the coffee heat for a longer period of time as I've repeatedly used it. Overall, this is a good travel mug, but it is nothing special.",neutral,mug
"pro(s):- The lid + button double redundancy makes it really great for someone like me who would usually spill coffee all over themselves on their subway commute- good insulationcons:- It was leak proof for ~6 months, but now I’m experiencing slight leakage from the button you have to press. it’s expected for the rubber seals to eventually wear out, but this felt premature, and really negates the purpose of a reusable coffee cup (to reduce waste from disposable ones)- the button system makes the lid difficult to clean. there are a lot of nooks and crannies that require a really tiny brush to prevent mold",neutral,mug
"Got this travel mug after reading great reviews across many sites. Wanted something I could slip into my purse while commuting on public transit to free up both hands while traveling. In that respect, it's been great - I've never had a leak, even when it ends up horizontal in my bag while full. Unfortunately, my coffee - which I pour into the Contigo while piping hot - is no more than lukewarm by the time I arrive at work 45 minutes later. I've read other reviews that say it keeps coffee hot for several hours, so maybe I received a dud... But overall, I'm disappointed and will be purchasing a rival brand that's known for keeping liquids very hot all day long.",neutral,mug
"This travel mug has too many moving parts, and so many little areas where liquid will get into. This makes the mug lid very tedious to clean. One area seems to be impossible to clean because it’s screwed down with a triangle screw.I wish this mug had a simple lid.",neutral,mug
I have many contiguous thermos and this one and the replacement both leak not what the product used to be,neutral,mug
"I purchased this mug as a replacement for my wife, as she had lost her previous contigo, but when it arrived the bottom plastic piece on the cup had not been seated properly and leaves a rough edge on the mug. Unfortunate, and this would have been a 5 star review but we seem to have received a bad one. That being said, I would not hesitate to recommend this to someone looking for a travel mug.",neutral,mug
"I love the look of this mug, extremely stylish. My biggest concern is that when filled with hot liquid, the steam has no way to escape. When I press the button to get a drink, the steam build up shoots out, sometimes hot liquid in tow. Once I had tea bags in it and I opened the mug to take them out and tea exploded out as soon as I twisted the top. This is almost an impossible thing to fix, as you can put holes in a leak-free mug. Just be careful!Update: I've noticed that my mug leaks pretty heavily when held horizontally. It also tends to leak liquid when I screw the lid on.",neutral,mug
"I am a fan of the Contigo mugs but am so very disappointed in this one.  A non-spill lid was a must for me as I put the filled cup in my work bag.  That feature works well on this product.  HOWEVER, it is usually an hour before I can drink my hot tea and with this mug it is more like lukewarm tea (ick).  My other Contigo mugs keep my tea hot for hours (3 or more) while this mug doesn't seem to keep it warm for more than a half hour.  So if you don't plan on drinking relatively quickly, I wouldn't recommend this product.",neutral,mug
"Bought this for my morning coffee. The locking no-spill switch is pretty nice and the bottle itself is great, but the inside of the cap where the locking device is housed is full of mechanics that are very hard to get into and clean. Despite how much I soak and clean it, residue builds up inside the cap really easily and it's very gross. There is a push-button that pops out some of the locking mechanism for better ease of access when cleaning, but it's really not enough. The amount of daily detailed scrubbing I have to do for a mug I use every day is irritating.",neutral,mug
"I think that it does what it's supposed to do, and my drink remained too hot to drink for a couple of hours so next time I used it, I allowed my drink to cool to a temperature I could drink before putting it into the mug.  That worked - the mug kept it at a warm temperature for more hours than I needed.  But one annoying thing: I used it when I was in a business meeting and it kept dribbling on me.  Thank goodness it was just tea and didn't stain my clothing or the chair I was sitting in - but that alone will make it impossible for me to use this mug except when I'm at home.",neutral,mug
"Good Contigo quality, but prefer an older model. When you open this one, the liquid comes out in a quite large receptacle and, particularly with hot drinks, you are not always able to swallow all the quantity right away. Then the liquid has a tendency to go overboard and spill on your chest. Therefore you have to master the right inclination of the Contigo not to spoil your clothing.",neutral,mug
"I am a huge Contigo fan! My friends will swear by this since I tell them all about it. Unfortunately, I do have to give this one a three star because I don’t really like how the turnstile makes it hard to clean and it also causes leakage. So when I turn it, the fluid ends up on top of it and if I turn it upside down then it ends up on me or on whatever’s around me or I have placed it in. Otherwise, I can never say  enough about Contigo brand.",neutral,mug
"I can't emphasize enough how the hot liquid hits your lips as soon as you press the release button.  There's no ""pocket"" or well to hold the liquid prior to contact so you can blow on it , or ease it on your lips. It's shockingly brutal.  If you like hot beverages, and you enjoy the pain of pinpointed, scalding liquids against your lips, then this is the travel mug for you!",neutral,mug
"I loved my old contigo...wore out two of them. They were the tapered design, with the locking mechanism.  I miss the locking mechanism--where I couldn't accidentally hit the button and spill things. But even worse, this design is harder for my small hands. I thought the grip would be an improvement, but the diameter where you hold the mug is larger and completely straight up and down. It will fit better in my car holder, but that is the only thing that's better. Regretting this purchase.",neutral,mug
Don't like the fact you have to push on lid to drink from it. Everything else stays hot or cold for at least 6 hrs.,neutral,mug
"While this travel mug has a good form factor and high quality materials, it has a few issues as well. The lid will always have some of what you're drinking beaded up on the outside due to the nature of the mechanism, so you can't safely throw this in a bag without fear of staining your stuff. It also barely keeps drinks hot for an hour, and after two it's just above room temperature. I recommend a Zojirushi travel mug if heat and moisture retention are important to you.",neutral,mug
This is an awesome travel mug to keep your coffee warm or your cold drinks cold. However..... If you use creamer in your coffee this is not the travel mug for you. Cleaning the lid is really hard there are a lot of nooks and crannies... I didn't realize it until I had huge chunks of black gook in my dish water and started looking at all the pieces. Definitely buy a small baby bottle brush to clean it.,neutral,mug
The cup works fine but water gets trapped under the rubber sleeve creating some unpleasant mildew smells.  Something similar happens under the spout cover but you can take it off while washing/drying.I plan to keep using the cup but I cut off the rubber sleeve.I also have the Stanley Classic One Hand Vacuum Mug and prefer it to the Contigo but both more than get the job done.,neutral,mug
"I have been buying Contigo's for 10 years and recently noticed that I have consistently been buying replacement cups every 6 months! I use these daily at home or while driving and love their grip, lid, and design but no matter what version of Contigo I own after 6 months they always start leaking. I guess I expected better as people say these last for years???",neutral,mug
"I love Contigo products, unfortunately this bottle does not open very well. The hole is not big enough or the design is just bad but when I go to drink there is no steady stream of liquid and sometimes I think it is empty and I unscrew the lid and it's still half full! I still use it everyday, my drinks stay hot up to ~5 hours, and it definitely it spill proof but dang the lid design sucks. Would not recommend or buy again.",neutral,mug
El termo llegó sin la tapa del sello. Muy descontento con esto.,neutral,mug
Hard to close so it doesn’t leak and doesn’t stay as hot as other contigo models.,neutral,mug
"I’ve been a fan of contigo products for years and have been using the original auto seal tumbler. When I found out that this edition existed I had to have it because it keeps the spout covered. My only complaint is that it doesn’t keep my beverage hot for too long. Within an hour, my coffee is like warm. I do like the way it looks, but functionality wise ... I liked the previous model better.",neutral,mug
"I ordered this mug because I love the lid configuration. Easy to use while driving and seals up so no spillage and nothing gets in my drink. Downside: insulation is not very good. Not like a hydro flask or similar. Only keeps hot beverage warm for a couple hours, not the 5 as advertised. Also it is a bit heavy without the benefits of adequate insulation.",neutral,mug
For some reason the drink not coming out like it use to. Something wrong with the cover.,neutral,mug
Does not keep ice very long.,neutral,mug
"I like the comfortable grip on this mug. Also, it keeps coffee hot for hours as described. However, the sipper hole is recessed down into the lid, and you can't take a drink without hitting your nose. It's really frustrating to do your makeup in the morning and by the time you get to work it's all rubbed off your nose.",neutral,mug
"A great case of an overdesign of a simple product.  It does a good job; however, it is a tad bit over-engineered. The top is labor intensive to clean with several parts to remove.  I fear that over time, the parts may break from all of the snapping apart to clean the cup.  I have other cups that keep fluid just as hot and, are much easier to drink out of and to clean!",neutral,mug
I use to keep milk product cold. Which it does with addition of a few ice cubes. It can handle being dropped or knocked off table. My complaint is it is a pain to clean. Top protector must be snapped on/off to cleaned. Inside of cap has difficult to clean areas. For my needs I will not get another.,neutral,mug
"The button to hold it open was too small for me.  Also, the cover turns when you tighten the lid and vice versa.  A little too sophisticated for me.",neutral,mug
I lost my old contigo in the airport and picked up this as a replacement; it works great to keep coffee hot; its as good as all the other contigos I have bought.  It collects fluid on the seal and drips almost every time you go to take a drink unless you are being very cognizant of the situation.  Its quite frustrating to drink out of; however its great for not spilling and keep stuff hot or cold when not in use.,neutral,mug
It’s leak proof when it’s closed and before you drink out of it. Once you start drinking it-it leaves liquid in the lid and leaks from the top. To much of a hassle. I’m disappointed in the fact that contigo is usually a good product. This design doesn’t cut it,neutral,mug
"I really liked the style and overall function of this contigo. Used it for less than two months and it started to leak at the seal. Never dropped it, just started leaking at the grey/teal seal for some reason. Doesn't appear I can return it. Hopefully seller will read review and send me a new one. Otherwise I really liked it. Maybe I got a defective one.",neutral,mug
"Good looking product that seems to be of good quality. The bad, coffee only stays warm for maybe an hour and the mug absorbs a lot of the heat so it’s a good thing they have a rubber grip. I was disappointed because I have used Contigo products before and was very happy with them.",neutral,mug
"I love this thermos; it does keep my tea hot.  However, I feel that the black, twist top is a bit flimsy.  It broke when the thermos fell off the counter and hit the floor.  Not that I expected it to be indestructible, but the little plastic top is essential and it breaks easily. Not sure if I could get a replacement.  I plan to inquire.",neutral,mug
Bought this for my bf. He likes it but it's such a pain to clean!!!!!! I have to literally clean it with small tiny brushes and qtips.,neutral,mug
"Nice new base and grip material. Had the previous style and actually prefer it to this one. The new style lid is a bit flimsy and the twisty cover works every time, but makes it difficult to clean off the tea stains under it. It appears to pop offevery now and again....not sure it is supposed to though.  It's nice to have the new style inside the lid as that is much easier to clean.",neutral,mug
"This item looks nice and feels pretty durable. The only problem I have with it is that heat escapes from the separation of the lid and the bottle, making anything last (mostly hot liquids) for around 3 hours. After that, stuff will get pretty cold in there.",neutral,mug
"I am used with the brand. And I like the design of this one BUT it is not efficient to keep the temperature long enough. Also, you have to be careful when you open to drink otherwise you pour it all on yourself...",neutral,mug
Beautiful mug but I am concerned about the nooks and crannies of the lid.  I use a tiny brush that I bought but I worry about the build up of possible contaminates.  I’m not using it much now.,neutral,mug
"I hate that I can't give this five stars, because I absolutely love the look and design of this mug. However, I bought it specifically for tea, and it gave the tea a really bad taste. The functionality and sealing action on this thing is an A+. Just a bummer that it gives anything you drink out of it a metallic taste.",neutral,mug
"I got mine in the mail today, but it has some marks all over it. Sad, but it’s definitely leak proof.",neutral,mug
"For some reason I couldn't give a seller feedback through the web. Anyway, 5 stars for leaking proof, but it doesn't keep the coffee warm for so long. It loose heat through the plastic lid.",neutral,mug
I bought this because it was cute. But the autoseal makes it difficult to clean (it worries me that it isn't getting clean). Also it is difficult to get a good drink. The opening is too small.,neutral,mug
The regular model Contigo has is a lot better in terms of the water seal.The color makes for a stain magnet,neutral,mug
"I like that it seals the coffee inside until I push the button, so it definitely does not leak at all.I dislike that I can't control how much coffee comes out when I push the button, so I'm always burning my mouth with hot coffee. I'm hoping I will get used to it.",neutral,mug
"Keeps coffee hot, and it doesn't spill. Great design as well. Those are three pluses. Now the negative. DO NOT SIP THE COFFEE WITH THE LID ON WHEN YOU FIRST POUR IT. YOH WILM BURN TOUR LIPS. Take the lid off and let it cool a bit. The only reason I gave it three stars, and not five!!!",neutral,mug
"for he most part it is a great mug although after about 3 or 4 weeks of use it will leak at the top whenever I put my hot tea in it in the morning. seems sturdy, maybe i got one that was a little defective.....",neutral,mug

"Add others have said, the back (under the cover which rotates) opens at the same time as the front so if you are not careful and have it tilted towards the back when you press the auto-seal button then liquid will 'leak' up the back. Then when you tilt it forward to drink, the liquid will come around the sides of the cover onto your face etc. Get the newer model.",neutral,mug
This ok but nothing special despite the good NYTimes recommendation.,neutral,mug

"This travel mug is by far my favorite . I have had many ranging from a few dollars to over $40. I paid about $20 for this mug and I love it. My biggest complaint as you can see in the pictures is the lid. While I like the lid I have replaced it 2x once I got a free one from the store I purchased the mug thinking it was defective and the second I paid for. This piece is cracked nearly all the way around and it is the part that covers the opening when not in use so it keeps it clean. I cant see spending more money to replace the whole lid again when a new one is nearly as much . I hate to get a totally new lid so I will be changing styles for my next purchase. It is also very hard to clean the lid inside.  I spent about  30 mins with hot water soap and a toothpick to clean out the auto seal button and spring inside. It was disgusting and that was after many washes in the dishwasher and by hand.  I noticed a strange taste with my coffee and could not figure out what it was , the mug was clean. I checked my creamer the coffee and couldn't find it ,until I looked really close at the inside of the lid and saw that it was disgusting around the auto seal spring.  I now pour boiling water into the lid and thoroughly clean the auto seal after each use, a simple rinse is not enough.",neutral,mug
"I've tried out quite a few thermal mugs over the years in my search for one that will hold heat better than other less-than-impressive mugs, and this one ranks up there with the best I've tried yet, although my search is not yet over.The rubberized base and grip on the body of the mug make it easy to hold, and make it steadier and more stable than any of my other mugs - accidentally bumping it with my hand doesn't send this mug flying like I've seen with my other mugs. The design of the grip of mine is attractive, and the color scheme is androgynous enough to be appealing to everyone.Regarding the claim of holding the heat for five hours, with my coffee being brewed from my Keurig directly into this mug, it does hold most of its heat, but I can't say that my coffee is anywhere near piping hot five hours in as compared to when first it hit the mug. I suppose I could microwave my coffee before pouring it in so that it stays hotter longer, but then that also means that I'm unquestionably going to burn my tongue if I try to drink it within the first hour's time of it being in this thermal mug. On top of that, it defeats the purpose, so the 5-hours-hot claim doesn't hold true for me.There's plenty of capacity for my double-sized dose of morning Joe to fit into this mug, along with my generous additions of cream/er and sugar, and the size is comparable to the others I've used in the past, so it fits my car's cupholders just fine.Overall, this is a good mug, and offers some nice features, but the most important thing for me is heat retention, and this one still falls a bit short for me.My search continues...",neutral,mug
"It was pitched as a good thermos-type travel mug on the wirecutter, but it seems to keep hot liquids hot only slightly better than a regular travel mug.  I now use a thermos brand travel mug that keeps my tea hot for at least 4 hours, maybe 5 (depending on hot it is when I pour it it).  I paid $35 for mine so I expected more out of it.",neutral,mug
I don't know in what conditions they tested the claims on this mug with but they clearly were not performed in ordinary conditions. This mug will NOT keep your drink hot for 5 hours. You would be lucky if it stays even lukewarm past 1 hour and a half when fully sealed [when it was filled with boiling liquid.] Maybe they did their test inside an oven or at least during a brutal heat wave in the desert. But typically you would use this for hot liquids in a cold environment...even in room temperature it will not stay hot for 5 hours as it claims...not even remotely close. It won't even be warm at that point. It does a bit more accurately with keeping liquids cold though...again...still not accurate.,neutral,mug
Great travel mug. I like that the contigo mugs are spill proof making them great for travel with kids. My only complaint is that somehow water got into the insulated chamber of the cup and I cannot get it out. Wash carefully and don’t let your mug sit in a sink full of water!,neutral,mug
"Update after one year: The rubbery plastic sleeve that forms the grip has come loose and came off during cleaning yesterday. I submitted a warranty report, but if it's only going to last a year of regular use I think I'm better off with something else.",neutral,mug
This mug is good but not as good as the other autoseal lids. The autoseal button is smaller than the other autoseal mugs. Not a big fan of the twist to lock cause things can get stuck in there and become moldy. The inside is easy to clean. Only keeps beverages hot for 3 not 5 like they said. Not bad for cold drinks.,neutral,mug
"Overall it's good. 3 stars due to cleaning. You will need a tooth brush if you for something other than water. Not terribly hard to clean, but I'm a truck driver and don't have a way to clean this as good as I'd like. Other than that it's great, no leaks and keeps coffee warm for a good amount of time. Did not test with cold icy liquids. Handles abuse well.",neutral,mug

There is a sliding cover to close the opening. Way too many steps for a drink although an attractive bottle.  Didn't test the capacity to keep drink warm or cold",neutral,mug
"Incredibly well built to keep drinks hot or cold.  Coffee stays hot for hours.  Everything cleans up nicely under the faucet...not in the dish washer!  The top stays on screw tight and the button which opens the mechanism to allow liquid to flow is one finger easy to push.  This is one well made travel cup.  Only issue for me, and 1-star downgrade, is that liquid flows very very slowly through the small hole opening.  If it were slightly larger to allow more liquid to flow I would give this 4-stars.",neutral,mug

I decided to get a second one for coffee, and bought the black one to be able to distinguish between the two mugs.  Used the black mug for one day and noticed a chip in the black paint.  Stick with the unpainted version.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I drink tea from this mug at work to ensure I do not spill it at my desk and computer.  The anti-spill auto seal works great.  No liquid can come out until the gray button is pressed, and once the button is released the mug auto seals.  The only thing I wish could be improved is the ease of cleaning the drinking area of the lid. A little bit of tea pools at the opening and creates a stain which does not come off easily.  Perhaps smoother plastic or metal would release the stain easier.",neutral,mug
"love most of these mugs but this one does not cut it, i suggest pulling off the very top cover piece and throwing it away or it will drip on you.",neutral,mug
"I have had contigo before,  this one only kept my really hot coffee hot, for a few hours,  4 or so,  after 5 it was just warm.  Only handwashed.  It was a prime deal.........",neutral,mug
Works well.,neutral,mug
"Hand wash only! I should have looked before I bought it. It's nice, it works, but that's the bummer!",neutral,mug

Leaks a bit compared to my more simple Contigo.,neutral,mug
OK not the best,neutral,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                  Purchased mine from Meijer for 24.99, which is a lot more than here, the Aqua green color one. It works well, kept my coffee warm, not hot, for most of the morning, into early afternoon. The bad thing is that I knocked it over and it fell off onto the floor, breaking the slide-around part on the top side of the lid. It really needs to be made with more rubbery type material because this part was so easily broken. Otherwise I REALLY liked this mug. All others were difficult to keep clean or never sealed well enough.",neutral,mug
"This looks nice and is easy to clean, but after 90 minutes, a half drunk mug of tea is lukewarm a best. Great for a short commute...not so great for a long morning.",neutral,mug
"I love everything about this mug except that it dribbles on you when you drink from it after a while. The look, the feel, the size, the auto seal, the length of time your coffee stays hot.......all excellent. The only problem is the cap (that spins around to lock the push button and keep the spout clean) allows coffee to collect which inevitably finds it's way over an edge and works it's way around so that when you have a drink it drips on your clothes. I've tried everything, including trying to make sure that any coffee left in the spout after a drink is drained back in to the mug by double pressing the button, but somehow it finds a way to dribble on you. I'm going to try the Luxe, as it seems like the exact same design, but with a button to lock instead of the coffee catching dribble cap.",neutral,mug

"Yeti 20 oz stainless steel tumbler.  I actually purchased this as a gift for my niece who is a very busy exec.  She loves it.  That it's reusable and washable.  Keeps hot stuff hot for a several hours.  She also loves the bronzy color.  Win/win/win!   Having said all of this, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful. All of my reviews reflect my honest, personal experience with the reviewed item - your experience may be different. I am not influenced by any outside source. I receive/accept NO free products or discounts that are not available to all shoppers- ever. For some reason our shopper ranks are no longer visible - so, to give you a little more info about me, I am a top 50 reviewer (#30 the highest rank achieved). Those numbers used to fluctuate over time - up and down but I noticed that they stopped updating regularly - perhaps to phase them out. It's a shame because it did help you see who has been around the longest and who is a trustworthy reviewer.  I've been doing reviews for over 25 years with Amazon - over 6,000 reviews posted, those reviews have been viewed well over 50,000 times, including over 24,000 likes. Bottom line, I pay for all my stuff, just like you do.",positive,mug
"I purchased this tumbler for my brother-in-law as a Christmas gift. I purchased my sister one for her birthday and he fell in love with it. She won't share, lol. The Yeti is great for keeping liquids cold or hot for a long period of time. I gave one to my hubby two years ago. He carries it to work full of ice and when he gets home, the ice has yet to melt. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see how long the ice would last in the Yeti. It lasted for 5 days before it began to melt.  He still carries it to work and it's still going strong. The average price for a 20 oz is $35-$45 in some colors such as black and blue. Other colors such as red, pink, yellow, etc run around $70-$100. It may sound expensive, but it's the last tumbler you'll ever buy. We are a Yeti family and we're all happy.",positive,mug
"It came with the tags and info that confirms it is an authentic Yeti product. The magnetic lid is easy to slide open and closed. It doesn't seal completely, so it can spill when knocked over. Yeti offers different products that will seal completely, even when dropped from a backpack; but the Rambler is made for more casual use. All pieces are dishwasher safe (not just the lid) and the cup keeps liquids hot or cold for many hours. I will absolutely buy it again.",positive,mug
"I am absolutely a YETI fan! They have a great selection of colors; it keeps my drinks either cold or hot for an extended period of time and I love the fact you can put the cup and the lid into the dishwasher! Other brands you have to hand wash and when you work full time and have children, it just makes life easier to throw it in the dishwasher! I bought the yellow Tumbler and it is beautiful!",positive,mug
"So this is an amazing, strong, sturdy leakproof, legitimate, magnetic sip cover & overall lid & mug. I have a smaller/wider-different version yeti that I got from my physical store few years ago that I do love but there’s no lid closure and it’s too wide- so this one is even better. I tested it upside down with a drink in the sink and it passed. It’s fits my cup holders and tiny hands. It keeps my tea Hot for hours. While at work it was hot to warm for about 7 hours for my tea. It is awesome for me!!!",positive,mug
"This product was exactly what I had imagined and hoped for! It is the perfect size for a morning coffee, or a travel mug for other things. It keeps my coffee at the perfect temperature for up to many hours in the morning, and keeps my ice in it all day! Super pleased!",positive,mug
"I've had a Yeti 20 oz double wall mug for 20+ years.  It's my favorite mug becuase it keeps things hot or cold for a long time.  However, the old style lid just had a hole for sipping one's coffee without a cover.  Fairly easy to clean, but build up of coffee grime tends to need periodic cleaning with a brillo pad.  Also, if it tipped over it would spill quite alot - not as much as without the lid, but still enough to be troublesome.  So I bought this unit because of the new magnetic lid.  Its just like the old one (except copper in color) in terms of keeping my coffee hot for a long time and spillage with the lid MagSlider closed spills alot less liquid, but still not ""leak proof"".  Good enough in my book.  Also, I really like that one can remove the MagSlider for cleaning.  I've purchased 20 oz mugs from other manufacturers and they all have problems with cleaning the lid slider area and none of them keep coffee hot for as long as my trust old and copper new mugs.",positive,mug
Absolutely must have! I love having my coffee in the morning and like it hot. I had tried so many other cups and my coffee gets cold and have to keep reheating. I got this and it stays warm for hours also if you like your drink cold add ice can remain cold for days love this. Will purchase another for at home. This one I keep at work.,positive,mug
I can sip my coffee for hours at work or while at home with the kids.  I don’t need to reheat multiple times a day - it’s basically a mothers dream and a great time saver,positive,mug
"Perfect for on the go lifestyle. Yeti Rambler keeps my hot tea or coffee piping hot for hours on end, it even extends the life of ice cubes and keeps your cooler drinks as cold and as fresh as when you first poured it into the Yeti Rambler. My only complaint would be that the magslider is a bit of a challenge to clean as thoroughly as I'd like without breaking the magslider itself.",positive,mug
"I use it for my coffee at the horse barn.  The sipping lid easily slides closed, keeping the coffee cool and the  flies out in the summer, and the coffee hot n the winter. Easy to clean. These are the best I've had.  I now have 5.",positive,mug
"This is really a great water tumbler. I leave it at work, so easy to clean is important. And it's easy to put ice in it, unlike other styles. Ice water stays cold until the next morning.",positive,mug
"It's a wonderful Yeti tumbler of which I have two, a nice eggplant purple and that tedious seafoam green that was everywhere for awhile a few years ago and hey, they're Yeti and they keep your coffee nice and hot.

"A couple years ago I received a YETI tumbler as a present. It is hands down the best tumbler I have ever owned. It’s leak proof, keeps my coffee hot and the best part is the magnetic part of the lid that comes off so you can clean it.I love mine so much, I had to buy my husband one. Spend the money, you won’t regret it.",positive,mug

"It's a yeti, what could I say but it's the best. I bought one. Then I bought two more as gifts.",positive,mug
"The mug is very good, keeps the drink warm and also cold, just it's too bad that it is not 100% sealed to leaks. But I am very satisfied.",positive,mug
"It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for.  It does not leak at all, the magnetic slide to open and close the drinking port is brilliant.  I can clean under it with no issues and it does not get gunky like my other coffee mugs that have a plastic slider that is attached to the lid.  I ended up buying two more.",positive,mug
Other brands may keep your coffee hot longer but are too difficult to keep clean. The Yeti is easy to clean and will keep it hot for a decent amount of time.,positive,mug

"The Good:-Super sturdy-Keeps drinks cold-Easy to clean-StylishThe Bad:-A bit expensive but well builtThe Bottom Line:I use this Yeti Rambler everyday and all day for drinking cold water out of. It is expensive but it looks great and is well built. I like how easy it is to clean since there is no straw or anything with a lot of parts to clean. When the cap is closed it's mostly leak proof but I wouldn't throw it into a bag. Overall, I would recommend this mug for its build quality and style.",positive,mug
"I was skeptical about spending money on Yeti as they are pricey compared to other mugs but here's why I am a convert!1. They are well made and keep working.2. They keep things hot and cold for a long time.3. The are dishwasher safe!!  This was key, hate having to hand wash all the time!4. The MagSafe lids are great and make cleaning easier, take off the mag slider and pop in the basket, lid and cup on top shelf5. It doesn't spill when I sipNow they are not spill proof so don't tip them, other makes are better but for what I need love the styles and functionality.",positive,mug
Birthday gift loves it,positive,mug
It works,positive,mug
Got a 1000 mile trip in my near future.  This thing keeps my coffee hot and a soda cold plenty long.  Mine does leak but very little.  The lid itself seals very well.  The join between the magnetic slider and the inside rim of the lid does not have a seal.  The join is good enough that the leak (if you tip over the cup) is a very slow drip between the slider and the lid.  Acceptable to me.,positive,mug
What I like about the yeti is the magnetic lid.,positive,mug
I have been a truck driver for over 25 years and I have never used a better piss cup then this one! It keeps the pee at the perfect temperature and you don’t need to worry about leaks:),positive,mug

"Super, ultra happy with my Yeti tumbler!!! :-D I've never had an insulated mug or tumbler before, so I can't compare it to other brands. I was in the US visiting, and space/weight in my suitcase was limited, so I had to make it count; decided to go with a top brand right away, instead of trying a cheaper brand and risking it not being as good, or not lasting as long. So far I'm really happy!!! The alpine yellow color I chose is pretty and so uplifting. I wasn't sure about the exact model, so I chose the 14oz mug and also this 20oz tumbler. I do enjoy the mug best; I use it on my work desk, and I don't have to worry about knocking it over and making a mess. But this tumbler is awesome for the occasional hot tea around the house, and also for taking tea/coffee on the go (the mug would not fit in the holder on my car). The size is perfection, not too small and not overly large. Nobody ever mentions this detail, but the spot where I place my lips is super important; it cannot be too thin, or stay hot - it just needs to feel right, and this one does it for me. I gave it 4 stars for 'leak proof' because it's not meant to be totally leak proof, but I haven't yet make any messes carrying it around with the lid closed. I also gave it 4 stars for 'easy to carry'; yes, it fits very nicely in my hand, but I would have loved the option of a handle without having to pay extra. Highly recommended!!!",positive,mug
Nothing to dislike,positive,mug

I always thought yeti was over hyped but I’ve been converted not only does it actually keep my drink cold it is sturdy even with how clumsy I am. My favorite it all the colors you can get it in and the magnetic lid cover! All they need to do is come up with a device that helps you take off the o/ring easier to clean it and it would be perfect!,positive,mug

"If you're like me you might be confused by all of the 1 star reviews saying these are counterfeit and not leak proof.To begin with, you'll see one of the pictures I attached shows right on the sleeve that comes on the cup ""splash resistant to stand up to speed bumps and on the go carrying"". So yes, splash resistant is not equivalent to leak proof. This lid will probably leak if you intend on throwing this into a bag like you would a thermos with a screw on lid.Second, lots of reviews saying these are counterfeit and made in China. If you Google ""is yeti made in China"" the first thing you'll see from their own website says their ramblers are indeed made in China. The bottom of the cup says designed in Texas, made in China. That doesn't make this counterfeit. In fact, you can see the Yeti symbol is stamped into the steel on both the bottom and side. So if this is counterfeit someone went to an insane length to pass these off as legit. Also, it came with all of the inserts and whatnot from Yeti. Along with a sticker. If this thing is counterfeit it's the most elaborate counterfeit of all time.Lastly, I saw a lot of reviews saying they didn't get the right lid. Maybe so but I got a mag lid with mine. I wouldn't worry much about that. Probably a packaging mistake for those that happened to.So in closing, I feel very confident in saying if you want this you can safely ignore the 1 star reviews that mention being counterfeit or not being leak proof.",positive,mug
Second Yetti I have purchased.,positive,mug
"Keeps my coffee piping hot for hours.  I bought 5 to rotate throughout the week, along with the 30 ounce Tumblers, which also keep my water ice cold all day.  Worth spending a little extra.

"If you don't like Yeti, sorry.  I really like this for my coffee, keeps it warm all day, super easy to clean, and Yeti has replacement parts for days.",positive,mug
"Build quality-This thing will last longer than any truck I bring it into. An absolute tank in terms of build. Nice texture helps with grip as well. It's a bit on the heavy side. One caveat, the top will definitely pop off if dropped. It's not a screw top. Just a rubber gasket holds it in place.Heat retention- not the best I've had. Buy this mug if you're grabbing your coffee, and heading to the car. It's a travel mug, not designed for drinking hours later. It'll be warm, but definitely not hot.-I love the magnet sliding opening on the cap. Convenient and simple opening. And it's clear plastic so you can see what's in the cup-dishwasher safe. Another major reason I bought it.",positive,mug
This is a Christmas gift and you would think that Yeti would supply boxes for their items. I’m disappointed,positive,mug
My husband loves this cup. It's easy to hold. Keeps coffee hot for hours!,positive,mug
"I use it for cold drinks. It keeps ice and drinks cold for a real long time. The texture of the outside makes it easy to hold.

It's amazing.  Here in the  Tx heat of summer I have left my iced drinks in my car for literally a couple of hours  112° outside - waaay hotter inside the locked car.  When I got back, the drink still had ice and was cold.  Now that's amazing.  My hot coffee stays hot - not for as long as cold stays cold, but it is definitely fantastic.  $35 for a drinking glass?  Well worth it!!!!!",positive,mug

"I always thought the hype around Yeti’s were just that, hype. I didn’t get it. Well, my company ordered a bunch of travel mugs from them with the company logo and I loved it! My mom loved it too and didn’t give it back! LolSo, I purchased the bright pink 20 oz rambler for her birthday. Unfortunately, the “magslider”, used to close the mouth opening, was missing. I contacted Yeti, they apologized, and set a replacement “magslider” via next-day air. No questions asked!! I couldn’t believe it. I made the picture on Amazon, but Yeti customer service was assisting me.Yeti, you have an excellent product and I will continue to support you. Thank you for the excellent customer service.",positive,mug
"I had my previous tumbler for like a decade. It recently had a mishap and fell. The bottom piece came off and would not go back on. Weld broke. I immediate ordered a new one.

"There was an awesome sale so I bought 3x of these and they have been great. The color is incredible and I really want to get the same color on one of my sports cars at some point.Sidenote: The part of the lid that you slide to open and close the flow port is actually a magnet. I had been trying to clean around it then dropped the top and it popped off. I'd probably have never known that if it hadn't slipped out of my hands. Pretty awesome cause there is nothing to corrode, and it's super easy to clean the entire lid just by lifting off the magnet! PERFECT !!!  I love these even more now.The SIDE Sidenote: These do say MagSlider on the name, lol. I never read that, I just bought because of the design and color. Go figure.",positive,mug
Vale la pena porque si mantiene las bebidas frías y dura mucho tiempo el hielo si. Deshacerse,positive,mug
I want to keep it for myself!  LOL.  Bought as an early christmas gift for someone who is difficult to shop for- and loves coffee.,positive,mug
Great color and great Yeti quality.,positive,mug
"I love this cup so much, it really keeps my coffee very hot for a very long time.",positive,mug
Love this product,positive,mug
"I use my Yeti every day for lemon water and it keeps the water nice and cold, much better than previous brands I've tried.  A bit pricey  but worth it..",positive,mug
"Others have commented - It's NOT leakproof - not supposed to be.  If you want a Yeti that's leakproof they make them too.  Does a SUPER job of keeping drinks hot or cold for a long time - will keep ice for hours.  Bought this one for my wife as she kept trying to steal mine.  They have a great selection of colors and it's easy to clean as the lid slide pops off (magnetic).  Hers is purple, mine is black, so we can keep them straight.  These things are expensive, but in my view, worth every penny.  Great product!",positive,mug
"I love these. I know there are other brands but the yetis keep my coffee hot and my drinks cold. I had left I’ve water in the car, while I was out shopping (etc) on a 100 degree day, coming back that evening to still cold water. If I have appointments at work and can’t drink my coffee right away, it keeps it warm for hours. Same with my mid day hot tea. I’m not usually a “name” person but I can’t get enough of these.",positive,mug
ICE COLD!! Awesome cup. Definitely lives up to it's hype. Keeps drinks cold for several hours. When I make an ice water before bed ice will still be in the cup by morning. My only advice is be sure to remove the rubber seal on the cap to clean easily hidden build up. It's kinda tough to remove but absolutely necessary. I appreciate the design of the magnetic closure so there's no build up in it like other brands. This is my third Yeti and will purchase more.,positive,mug
Bought this as a gift for my wife. She likes taking cold drinks in the car and they never last long cold.This tumbler keeps the ice for hours on end we took a six hour trip and there was still ice in this yetiThe one negative is that if you leave the black yeti in the sun obviously it will warm up but even then we are amazed at how long the yeti keeps the drink cold.,positive,mug
The cup seems fine bought this for my elderly mother in law and she said the magnetic slider was missing.... I had to do a star rating.... and since I really didn't know I just gave it a 5 on all,positive,mug
Yet he never disappoints. Top notch quality product like always.,positive,mug
Hubby takes this to work every day and it keeps his coffee hot all day! Great hot cup!,positive,mug
These travel mugs are definitely worth the money.Only thing that upset me was I paid $24.99 on Amazon & it came with a sticker from Kohl's for $19.99.,positive,mug
Gracias 🙂 🙂!!,positive,mug
"These mugs are brilliant I made my coffee at 5am and it was still warm at 8am I love it No leak problem and have been using it for quite some time now…. All I would say is, they are very reliable and you wont be sorry",positive,mug
Very comfortable to drink from. Fits in my cup holders. Lockable valve ergonomically positioned. Insulation works better than expected.,positive,mug
I put a cold drink in my cup and it was 110 degrees outside.  I had an appointment and was gone 2 hours.  Came back to my drink and ice was still in the nice icy cold cup.  Great proxy.  I now have two of these and will be making gift for holidays.  I strongly recommend.,positive,mug
"My partners goto coffee mug, attractive, practical and very functional. I have also bought one for my sister. Excellent delivery service (Now our borders are open). These will make great Xmas presents should you be so inclined.",positive,mug
I feel a little stupid  because I was drinking from the wrong end. I actually gave this thing one star because it was leaking from the spout as it turns out I was drinking from the wrong end because it does come out of that end as well but that’s just an air slot the button is behind it and you drink from the other side. I was going to come on to redo my review at the minimum to give it another star because of how hot it keeps thngs. And I’m talking about when the top not even on it it keeps it hot for a long time. But at 9 o’clock in the morning today I made tea I just took the cup and poured it into the sink because I figured that it will be ice cold by now it was actually still lukewarm after all those hours.it’s 603PM PM!!! I was so embarrassed about my review that I had to redo it and erase it completely because I was so obviously wrong but  I’m pretty sure that this is happened to somebody else as well. This is the best one I have ever had. End of story. Nothing is better than us. Mine is blue it is extremely durable and as I said before it keep stuff hot. It’s sealed it completely not one week it is the best one I’ve ever had again I just said that and I’ve had so many different kinds over the years this is by far the best one,positive,mug
"These are very well made travel mugs. They are attractive, beautiful colors, and keep the beverage either hot or cold for a long time. I like the way they feel in your hand.",positive,mug
My wife loves these and this is the third one she has goner through. The only caveat is the finish on the mug tend to wear off after a while and we only hand wash the thing.,positive,mug
"Q: Does it insulate?A: Like gangbusters! Drop ice in there at 8am and you'll still have ice at 10pm. Same for hot beverages. It defies the laws of thermodynamics.Q: Is it leakproof?A: Most assuredly! Better yet, it's foolproof and accident proof too.Q: Is it well constructed?A: There's always a chance it will dent if dropped on a hard surface but other than that it's relatively indestructable. I've been using one Contigo travel mug for 6 years now and, other than a few scratches, it still works good as new.Q: Do I recommend purchasing this item?A: Hells yeah! No regrets.",positive,mug
"The Contigo Autoseal West Loop 2.0 Travel Mug has become my favorite.  I received one in a Keurig Package offer and thought ""oh great another mug to clutter up"".  I tried it and I am now throwing out all of my other travel mugs and have ordered more in different colors.  I have 5 so far with more on the way.First, mine DO NOT Leak.  The inside of the lid is a little tricky and when you unsnap it to clean it, you DO need to make sure it is snapped back completely.  Not difficult or complicated, just easy to overlook.  I have turned it completely upside down, half full, in the middle of a store to show it off.  Though I forgot to click the lock when I threw it in my purse, it still did not leak.  Those that have posted theirs leaked may not have the autoseal snapped all the way, or a faulty one as none of mine have leaked.Second, hot or cold, it stays that way.  Hot liquids I like to leave the lid off for a minutes or remind myself to be careful as those first sips will be a bit too hot.  The hot liquids may cool down quicker than the cold ones will warm up, but I've never had any mug without an internal heater that kept my hot beverages hot for this long, I'm not sure if the posted complaints are expecting more than can be expected because mine, if not HOT, they are at least pleasantly warm at the end of 1 to 2 hours and I do not like LUKEWARM hot beverages..  COLD.  Almost unbelievable.  Without the lid and with ice, drinks will stay cold for hours.  With the lid I have had ice and drink remaining overnight.  I now walk around the house with my iced water or tea daily.",positive,mug
"I love carbonated waters. They need to be cold and secured. This container does both and I have already purchased a second one. If you love cold bubbles drinks, you will love this container.",positive,mug
"I bought this on Prime Day for $12! (I got 2 because I had a $12 credit from another product). They’re so great and the perfect size. I can fit a normal cup of coffee in one and it stays warm for hours. I’ve even put cold water in it, in which is stayed cold for hours, too! I love the auto seal capability and the locking mechanism, for extra piece of mind. I’ve already knocked it over at my desk and in my car and not a drop was spilled. The colors are vibrant and I love the stainless steel and feel to them. I use mine every day.The customer service was also great. My teal tumble arrived with a dent in it. I quickly notified the seller and they put another one in the mail the same day and it was delivered the next day. No questions asked. (I did return the dented one, of course). I’m not sure how much they are now, but it’s definitely worth having.",positive,mug
We have purchased 7 of these now... We have stopped using any of our other travel mugs and have had two of these go missing...  They are great and a decent price.  Looking through the other reviews will give you all the tips you need to know but here are the ones that rang true for me so far...hot liquid creates a pressure wit the sealed lid and it gives off a little poof of stem when you push the button after its been sealed for a while...  like your coffee is spitting in your face if you are not careful...  Color comes off if you use the dishwasher which it tells you not to do in the directions.The only issue I have is I like to drink a cup off coffee before I leave the house in the morning but this thing keeps the coffee a little too hot to drink...  I leave the lid off and let it cool so I can drink and then top it off before I leave.,positive,mug
"Excellent product, 10 outta 10",positive,mug
lid leaks after 30-days of use.,positive,mug
"Definitely leak proof. I click the lock on top and have no worries of it spilling if it's knocked over. It's easy to drink from and doesn't pour too much or too little out at a time. I use this daily with hot drinks and I handwash it. Make sure it's dried all the way before using it again, because if not, when you hold the button on the back, some water (from it being washed) will come out and make you think it's spilling. The only wear and tear it shows is a silver ring around the bottom of it where it sits down (you only see it if it's upside down), which is expected with daily use and painted metal.",positive,mug
"Works great, keeps the coffee hot and does not leak.",positive,mug
"This is perhaps the perfect travel tea mug.  I have another Contigo Autoseal that came with a tea basket which I can use in this mug as well.  I purchased this 2nd mug because I used a spicy tea with lots of cinnamon in my first Autoseal mug and the cinnamon stained the mug.  I can use this new mug for my Earl Grey tea and save the other one for Chai.I have never had either mug leak even upside down in my bag.  I also love how the lid works by more fully opening up, I can get a little brush into the nooks and crannies to get out any traces of milk or honey.I highly recommend these mugs!",positive,mug
This is a great tumbler. The lid is easy to affix and it seals well and is not difficult to use. Very handy and better than most others I have.,positive,mug
"I have appreciated Contigo products for quite a while, and this one did not  disappoint",positive,mug
"Words cannot describe how much I love this mug!  My house is littered with travel coffee mugs but as soon as I took a chance on this one, it was love at first drink!  I use it daily and I do mean daily!  It keeps your coffee hot for a better part of the morning and it doesn't spill.  I have a 2 year old and I dont have to worry about him spilling my coffee on himself.  He tips this and pours it and nothing comes out!  I throw it in my car on my way to school and it never spills!  I even bought two more when it was a prime day deal.  I actually carry two with me to school now!",positive,mug
"My husband uses this for a coffee cup every morning and it is ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.  IT KEEPS YOUR PRODUCT HOT/COLD for MANY, MANY HOURS.  MOST AMAZING CUP TO HOLD HEAT WE AVE EVER PURCHASED.I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT WILL NOT BREAK IF YOU DROP IT, LIKE YEARS AGO.  IT IS STAINLESS STEEL UNLIKE YEARS AGO CUPS WOULD JUST SHATTER WITH ALL THAT SILVER MESS INSIDE & BE RUINED FOREVER.WONDERFUL CUP.  MUST TRY!!!!PRICEY BUT WILL LAST...............AND WORKS AMAZINGLY",positive,mug
All others have dribble built in. The west loop has a drinking hole you completely cover with lips. All other styles dump bev onto the top of the cup and then you pour into open mouth. VERY messy. This style is best - compare and you will never NOT buy West Loop versions,positive,mug
"These mugs are great. I have probably owned 4 or 5 of them (not because they wear out, because I lose them), they keep things hot for hours and cold for even longer. Sometimes I have to take the lid off and let my tea cool down so that I can drink it without burning my tongue. I bought this one as a gift, and the color was really pretty and maybe slightly bluer than the picture.One thing though -- the colored versions of these mugs are not labeled as dishwasher safe, while the plain stainless steel ones are. This is because eventually the colored coating starts to peel off of these in the dishwasher. Just be aware. If you are particular about your mug color and it not being peeled, best to hand wash or buy the plain one.",positive,mug
I mainly use this for bedside overnight beverages.  It keeps my ice water cold for more than 12 hours.  The size is great - not too large for my hand or the car cup holder.  I have not noticed any leaking.  Also LOVE the color!  I have not washed in the dishwasher.,positive,mug
"This is my most favorite travel mug I've ever had. I've been using it a few months, I throw it in my work bag and I've never had any leaks. It keeps my coffee pretty warm to hot for a good few hours - maybe up to 4 hours, which I very much appreciate, as I can get busy working at the hospital so I often don't have time to sit down to drink my coffee all in one go. Just make sure to pull out the drink tab when washing the lid so all the parts can get nice and clean. It's  a bummer that the body isn't machine washable, but other than that it's perfect.",positive,mug

"Contigo Autoseal mugs are the best spill-proof mugs I've used or seen; I've been using Contigo mugs for at least 6 years.  I work in an area with a lot of computers and am required to use a spill-proof cup with positive auto seal (that is, they seal ""by themselves"").  Everybody in the area uses Contigo mugs.  The West Loop mug improves on, and removes, the one design flaw of the earlier versions of the mug:  the lids were nearly impossible to clean.  The seal mechanism on the new lids can easily be popped open so that the mechanism and the lid under it can easily be cleaned.  And, personally, I love the teal color :-)",positive,mug
Perfect gift! My friend loves that it is leak proof. She was always spilling her water getting in and out of the car with hands full. She loves the color. Design is comfortable in her hands.,positive,mug
"I love these Contigos, and have purchased many of them.  They never leak, keep my beer frosty cold, and don't explode (from the carbonation) when I click it open to sip.  I like the locking feature (which really works) and they're great looking!  The only caution is that you do need to wash the top well...  I didn't pay enough attention to that with my first one and it got a little icky where the spring is.  But I wash it in hot soapy water and it stays perfect for a long time, even with daily use.",positive,mug
"I love this mug and use it every single day for coffee in the morning, however the inter-spout does stain and but just like a good grill you need some left over coal to helps the taste. Love the color too, the option of colors are amazing as well. Non Spill option is the best.",positive,mug
"I purchased it because of the ads where they are letting it spill then closing the top when going over a laptop.  It's true; if you put the top on correctly, it does NOT leak.  We carry hot drinks into the sanctuary  to drink during the service and I can carry it in my purse or a tote and I'm happy to report when I get the top on properly, it absolutely does not leak.  I would love another one that holds a bit more.",positive,mug
"This is my second contigo and I prefer them to regular coffee cups as it keeps my coffee hot for longer and doesn’t spill if it’s knocked over. The only downside is the chipping on the outside as time goes on but the value of it outweighs that.Cleaning the inside isn’t difficult , you just have to remember to lift the seal and clean underneath. Overall well worth the price.",positive,mug
I have gone through a lot of travel mugs and I swear by this one. It keeps my coffee warm for hours and doesn't leak.The lid screws on so it's on tight and not one of those lids you push on. I kept knocking the travel mugs over that had the handle if it wasn't in the right position as I'm reaching for it on my desk so the fact that this doesn't have one is perfect. Plus not all the mugs with a handle fit in the car mug holder. I would never buy another brand of travel mug again.,positive,mug
"So amazing!If you tend to have clumsiness with drinks, and want ease when cleaning travel mug mouthpieces , this one is for you.You have to press the button down to drink, and you can lock the button when not in use. I put it in my handbag many times, even horizontally, still no spill. The headpiece screws in really tightly. Also safe to use next to electronics-no more mug spills.Heat insulation is also really good, great for cold weather and/or if you are a slow drinker.Very well worth the price.",positive,mug
Superior heat and cold retention.  Does not leak and 16 oz. size is perfect for car cup holders and Keurig Brewers! Biscayne Bay color is an excellent choice for both men.Highly recommend.,positive,mug
"I often find myself on upholstered chairs without adjacent tables, so spilling is a problem with me. This mug eliminates that risk.My only wish is that a plastic version was available to allow me to microwave reheat additional cups of coffee later in the day, long after I've consumed pours that started the day. Metal sparks in a microwave!",positive,mug
"Best travel coffee mug - we have at least 6 in our house. Keeps everything super hot or cold and it never leaks. I am even comfortable enough to toss it in my purse full of coffee and not worry about it spilling in any way. I love this matte teal color, wanted a little more color variety and this fits the bill. Contigo is the brand of choice in our house as long as the AUTOSEAL mug is in their lineup because it is hands down the best!",positive,mug
"I use the cup for water at night. Keeps the water clean and safe from anything getting in it. I like the way the button works. I am very happy with my cup, and my wife and I have six in our cabinet. We also use the cups for travel. We never have to worry about them leaking or spilling. Excellent cups.",positive,mug
"I have purchased 4 or 5 of these travel mugs over the years as they are the best ones made.  They keep hot drinks hot for hours and ditto for cold.  They don’t leak, come in beautiful colors and are stainless steel.  I have several of them for gifts to others.  Terrific product!",positive,mug
"Being a conscious consumer, I try to buy products I know will last. My father adopted my contigo mug from 5 years ago and refuses to give it back because he loves how long it preserves his beverage temperature. I'm more impressed that a mug used by construction workers has been around for 5+years. I highly reccommend any Contigo product.",positive,mug
"I like it for my coffee, it keeps it hot and in hot weather it keeps drinks cool. 💕",positive,mug
"Fill it up and toss it around.  You can't make it leak.  It'll dent and scratch, but takes a beating.  One drawback... the plastic top takes a few uses to lose the 'plastic' taste it emits into the hot beverage.  And just rinse the top well.  No soap or it will pick up a soapy taste.  Not a deal breaker though.  It's a keeper!",positive,mug
Keeps my coffee hot for hours. Fits in my car (2018 RAV) cup holder perfectly. DOES NOT LEAK and is very durable. I will be buying a second one this winter. EZ to clean. Very satisfied with this,positive,mug
This travel mug is the greatest.  No more spilled coffee in the car for me.  I would highly recommend this travel mug to anyone who takes refreshment with them and wants hot coffee hot or iced tea cold after several hours or longer.  It has all the features of a more expensive travel mug at a very reasonable price.  I've been using this mug on a regular basis even at home since I got it for Christmas.  Love it!!!,positive,mug
This does not leak at all. Fits in car holder perfect.,positive,mug
This is such a great travel mug! It stays warm for hours and never leaks. Well worth the money!!!!,positive,mug
"This mug is very well-made, and will keep your coffee very hot for a long time.  When I used it for the first time, I didn't realize how effective it would be at keeping coffee hot  and I actually burned the inside of my mouth as a result! Now I just let it sit for a few minutes with the lid off after it brews  so that it's not boiling hot when I'm ready to drink it.  Love the color!  And the paint doesn't chip or peel off like it does on cheap mugs.",positive,mug
Really great for if you’re on the run! I can drink my tea hot even hours after I’ve brewed it and the travel cup is peak-proof! I’ve never had a spill. 100% recommend for someone who is on the go all the time and needs to have their cup of caffeine in the morning :),positive,mug
"Love this mug! It keeps my coffee hot while I'm working out at the gym...and keeps water cold even after sitting in the sun. When I fill it with water and ice for my overnight water supply, the ice cubes are still unmelted the next morning. It's also pretty, erognomically easy to hold (no hot/cold sensation on the outside,) and it fits under my Kuerig coffee maker spout. Seems to be spill proof too.",positive,mug
I got this for my son who is in the Air Force.  He is stationed in a very cold climate right now.  This does the job.  Keeps his hot beverages hot while he does his job.  No leaks or spills.  We only use Contigo.,positive,mug
I love that it it's leak proof. It's pretty to look at and does what it's supposed to.,positive,mug
I had been looking for something to keep coffee hot at my desk since the lunchroom is quite far from my desk. This travel mug works great for this purpose! I fill it first thing and it stays hot the whole morning! I did read the instructions and have had no problems at all. I do leave the lid off for 5 minutes to cool it down slightly or I would burn my mouth. Very pleased with this mug!,positive,mug
"I had a Contigo SnapSeal for 2 years. It finally got too gross for me, so I chose this as its replacement. My favorite thing is that it fits under my Keurig, which the SnapSeal did not. The Autoseal helps keep my coffee warm for hours during my long shifts at work, and the lid lock means I can throw it in my bag when I need to and not worry about leaks. The easy-clean lid is very convenient. The better cleaning means better tasting coffee! I use this every day I work, and would highly recommend.",positive,mug
"At home to keep my coffee warmer longer than a cup . Can turn over and won’t spill. Great to travel with too, coffee stays hot a long time been useing this type of mug for years bought right when they came out . Given lots as gifts and they are as happy as I am with this mug,great colors too.",positive,mug
Autoseal works great. good coffe temperature. easy to use.Cleaned it in the dishwasher so color coating is pealing a bit on the edges.,positive,mug
"Perfect size for my Keurig.  I make a 12 oz cup  of coffee  and then top it off with the same K-cup with an additional 4 oz, for a total of 16 ounces. This fills the cup to the maximum.  It keeps my coffee  hot for hours, doesn't drip or leak and fits great under my Keurig 475 when I remove the drip plate.  I couldn't be happier!",positive,mug
"I decided to bring my own coffee into the office instead of spending money on fancy coffeeshop drinks. These containers make it really easy. Just fill them up, hit the lock, and you're good to go. No spills, the coffee stays hot for over half an hour, and they seem to handle dishwaters with no problem. I went back and bought a second one.",positive,mug
"Love the color! These cups keeps drinks cold (or hot) and once locked, they don't leak in my purse. I have had about a dozen Contigo cups over the years.",positive,mug
Came quickly. Love the color. Sometimes when you open it the liquid bubbles up but not enough to deter me from buying another. Has been dropped many times but has held its form wonderfully.,positive,mug
"Doesn't leak at all, stays warm for a few hours (if you take it to drink on road to work its better to cool down the liquid, otherwise too hot).The opening is pretty small, and I wish the mug itself was also dishwasher safe (the cover is!).",positive,mug
"Great product for the price. I use it daily, put it in the dishwasher, and have put both hot and cold coffee inside. Never once has it leaked on me! Keeps my coffee ice cold for up to 12 hours (including the Ice!) and hot for slightly less - around 6 hours. Would buy again!",positive,mug
This was a replacement for a lost like item.  It does seal.  I can lay the travel mug on the seat and it will not leak.  Works well with hot or cold liquids and the outside temperature of the mug is always at room temperature.,positive,mug
"This is fantastic! It keeps ice and ice water cold all day long.The lid opens up in a very ingenious way to clean it, but it still can be a bit difficult to get fully clean without a dishwasher. A dish brush is necessary if you don't have a dishwasher.",positive,mug
"We love these. My husband and I have been using them for months and I got one for my mother for Christmas. It is her new favorite coffee container. It keeps our coffee hot for at least 4 hours before it starts to cool down. We also love that it's spill proof, as we take these everywhere with us. If you drink anything on the go, you need this in your life.",positive,mug
It keeps my coffee hot from the time I brew it and add creamer before I leave for work to the time I'm ready to drink it (typically 3 hours after brewing). It cleans easy enough and I don't notice any major changes in the taste of my coffee which is typical of more cheaply made products.,positive,mug
I love the various colors this model comes in.  The no-spill lid is truly no spill - I’ve dropped it when it’s full of coffee and not a drop escapes.  Keeps my coffee hot for a few hours and warm for a few hours more - cold drinks stay cold too.  No-sweat surface even if you have ice cubes inside.,positive,mug
These are the BEST coffee mugs ever!,positive,mug
I love that I can sip from my coffee all day long and it stays hot. The lid is easy to clean. Make sure you have the lid on right or it will leak.,positive,mug
"Overall is a very good product, the cleaning process is tough for the lid( but most lids are very tough to clean). Doesn't leak and if cleaning becomes a problem, all you really have to do is just boil it and wipe after. Honestly, worth buying it for my dad and me.",positive,mug
"Surprisingly awesome.Works completely as advertised - absolutely no spills.Clever design of lid mechanism makes it super easy to clean (and is dishwasher safe).Vacuum wall design keeps hot beverages at temperature for hours (had tea that was nearly undrinkable it was so hot after 4 hours, haven't tried it with cold stuff, yet).Worth every penny considering competitors are harder to clean and 2-4 times the price.",positive,mug
This mug keeps my drink at the right temperature better than anything else I have tried. And I love the color!,positive,mug
"i use this every single day.  i have to put milk in my coffee to cool it down enough to drink, and then it will maintain that temperature for a couple hours if i accidentally forget about my coffee. love it.  i have accidentally dropped it and not a drop got out, which was a big reason i got this kind.",positive,mug
Best purchase ever! Carried it in my bag upside down filled with coffee. Put it in the pocket of my jacket. Keeps coffee warm for a long time. Basically one of those things one can’t live without.,positive,mug
"Love these mugs. I never have to worry that they will spill in my backpack. On long days I take 2 and know it will still be warm after 3 or 4 hours. Wish I could put the body on the dishwasher, but the small inconvenience is worth it",positive,mug
"This coffee mug has become my new favorite, everyday travel mug. It’s soneasy to use and the new style has made it just as easy to clean. It keeps my coffee warm for at least 6 hours and I never have to worry about it spilling. I completely recommend for any coffee drinker.",positive,mug
Contigo in my opinion is the best.  keep drink hot for hours and cold drinks cold.  The lock lid is helpful if on the move and juggling several items you don’t spill your drink.,positive,mug
"I love my Contigo!  It’s spillproof once the lid is screwed on.  I like the unlock/lock feature.  Once unlocked, the button is easy to push when drinking the coffee.",positive,mug
Title says it all! It is a dream to have a cup I can hold against me with all my junk in my arms and not have it spill on my shirt.,positive,mug
"This is the only travel mug I've ever found to be truly leak-proof.  You can fill it, put on the lid, turn it upside down and it will not leak.  Fantastic!",positive,mug
"I got this to take coffee on my way to work in the mornings and I absolutely love it! It’s dependable, simple to clean, keeps liquids hot for hours, and keep them cold as well. It also looks sleek and I love the color choices!",positive,mug
So far this is the best travel mug I have ever owned. And I have tried a lot. Super easy to clean and if leakage issues have been problem in the past not with this mug! I can turn it completely up side down and it doesn’t leak. Also keeps beverages warm at least 6 hours or more.,positive,mug
"This thing is a beast. It never leaks and keeps my coffee HOT (not warm) for hours. I love it.Update 8/22/17: I left this on top of my car yesterday and drove off. I was going about 30 mph when it fell off. I pulled over to retrieve it, and aside from a few cosmetic damages, it's FINE. My mind is blown. This thing is invincible.",positive,mug
"I purchased this product to test the new Contigo travel mug lid design. The new design is a VAST improvement which simplifies and facilitates very thorough cleaning. I subsequently purchased three more Contigo mugs. In addition to the new design, the manufacturing quality is outstanding, the retail pricing was excellent (at least on Amazon!!!), the online color representation was essentially true to reality. I highly recommend this product and intend to continue purchasing Contigo products.",positive,mug
Love it! It’s spill-proof even when it’s not locked.  Bought it for a trip to Europe and won’t need to worry about spills. I’m a happy customer.,positive,mug

I like the convenience of having the opening controlled each and every time by your fingers with no possibility of turning it upside down and spelling from it unless you have your fingers pressed against it. It keeps my hot beverage is hot!,positive,mug

I drink coffee all day long.  Wish it would hold more but it works great.  Love the mug.  Also easy to hold while using. If it was larger it would be unhandy  without a handle.  Also like the easy cleaning of the lid.,positive,mug

"I've gone through numerous travel cups over the years and, when I thought I finally found the right one (in size and keeping my coffee warm) it truns out to be very messy.A few weeks ago I began an in-depth search for the ultimate travel mug. I've learned that a GREAT mug has to have an air hole that makes drinking smooth. My last travel mug was the perfect size but every time you took a sip my coffee would kind of ""splash"" out as there was only one small opening.I happened on this Stanley Trigger-action thermos, watched some videos on this specific thermos and pulled the trigger.THIS IS THE ONE!!! My coffee stays HOT...and I mean ""right out of the pot hot"" for all morning long! I've taken a sip after it's been in my motorcycle saddlebags, traveling 25 miles in cold weather, over an hour later and almost burned my mouth!The trigger-action is excellent and, despite the lack of an air hole to help the flow, my coffee does seem to flow out without splashing!The size is perfect for what I was looking for. I bought the ""blue"" style and it looks great.Overall...a MUST for any coffee drinker that wants their liquid to stay hot without any leaks or drips! Highly recommended and worth the few extra $$ compared to the other brands that cannot do what this Stanley does!",positive,mug
"I tested 2 Yeti tumblers, a Contigo and this Stanley tumbler.  This one kept the product hot longer than the others. About 2 hours for me.  I like my drinks steaming hot. It also was the slimmest one.  I have small hands and the Yeti Stackable was too big to hold AND the plastic lid did NOT keep the heat in.  The Yeti Rambler 12 oz stainless steel came in 2nd in my opinion.  The Contigo had a good design, easy to hold but did not hold the heat for any length of time.  FYI - I boiled water poured it in each tumbler, took the temperature then waited and checked the temperature every 30 minutes for 3 hours.  This was the only one that kept the temperature refreshingly hot.  NOTE:  it seems that the vast majority of the tumblers now have a lid where a button has to be pushed to release the liquid to drink.  White this is a nuisance, it does work to keep the beverage hotter.",positive,mug
"This thing is amazing, I sip my coffee with no spills. At first, I was disappointed because it was only 20 oz, and I drink a lot of coffee. I wish they made a 24 oz and 32, but I can't find one. I love the ability to sit in bed and sip my coffee without the worry of spilling. Also, make sure you lock the inside of the top well, I think people don't do this and they get spills, but mine works great. I am in love.",positive,mug
This is the best one. After shopping around this is the best! What the other bottles don’t tell ya is that you hit your nose with every sip. This one has a cut out so your nose won’t hit when you sip. Also 100% leak proof which was my #1 priority as a person who has long commutes. I liked it so much I bought 5 in total. 2 for coffee and 2 for water. Coffee stays hot all day,positive,mug
"I had a friend who had one of these, so we had to get one. It works exactly as advertised, keeps the coffee hot for hours. The cleaning of the lid is slightly complicated on putting it back together again.",positive,mug
"I bought two of these for my husband & me. It's our go-to travel mug- We use them daily. No leaks. Well made too. Very easy to clean, the lid twists apart. Worth the investment!!",positive,mug
"The biggest reason why I bought this even though I have a perfectly functioning coffee mug is because of how easy this is to clean. Because the cap mechanism splits into two distinct parts, it's much easier too clean the coffee from the lid. Time will tell how well the lid holds up to repeated opening, cleaning, and closing, but hopefully it will be fine.",positive,mug
It works! A little pricey considering how many different manufacturers are out there. But I figured you get what you pay for. Keeps beverages hot (or cold) doesn’t leak.  Does what it’s supposed to.,positive,mug
Using since last few weeks (Nov 2022) and worked as described. Nothing special about this mug. Just my suggestion - Keep its upper portion clean all the time. It's using springs and some mechanical process to release the hot or cold water. So in case you are drinking herbal or tea leaves better to keep clean. I had issue in begining and its start leaking from release button. Overall it's a great mug and I would recommend. Enjoy ...!!!,positive,mug
"An actual leak proof beverage mug ! I have purchased mugs making this claim before , and they did leak ! But this lives up to the claim leak proof .",positive,mug
"This is a replacement for my old thermos cup/mug, of a similar but older design.This one works just as well as the old! So far, it keeps my coffee hot-hot-hot for 6 hours or so, which is when I usually start sipping on it. Of COURSE it starts to cool a little after that, as I'm breaking the seal and constantly exposing it to cool air, but in the 2 or 3 hours it takes me to finish off my coffee, it's still really hot, just not fresh-out-of-the-pot hot as when I start drinking it.As for reviewers talking about the plastic taste....do you people thoroughly WASH new drink ware you purchase? I mean, REALLY wash it?I took the lid apart, even the rubber O-ring, and ran it through the dishwasher. Lo and behold, NO PLASTIC TASTE when I put it together and used it! If you don't have a dishwasher,  then still take it apart completely, soak it in clean, soapy water for a few minutes, agitate it around, then brush clean it and rinse the heck out of it.I'll almost guarantee that's why people are complaining about the plastic taste...it may be NEW, but it NEEDS TO BE WASHED thoroughly BEFORE you start using it!The new design of the lid...I'm not sure yet if it's an improvement. It doesn't seem to be any more or less sturdy than the old design, so I'll have to see if it holds up. If it breaks, trust me, I'll update here. My last thermos cup lasted for 8 years of constant use, so if this one breaks before THAT one...I'll be quite unhappy...but it doesn't seem like I should have any issues.",positive,mug
"This product is far superior to YOUR thermos. Throw it, it will not leak. Neglect it, that coffee is hot the next day. Caution orange, just try and loose it…IMPOSSIBLE!",positive,mug

BF: “Dope ass coffee mug that doesn’t leak on my computer”,positive,mug
"I bought this mug in blue for my husband’s birthday, and I liked his so much that I had to buy my own. We were using Contigo mugs because we preferred the trigger action to keep our coffee from spilling and help hold in the heat. However they were hard to clean since they didn’t come apart in the lid, and the gaskets and trigger would grow mold. This Stanley mug’s trigger twists out for full access to thoroughly clean the lid and trigger. Also, liquids stay hot for hours and hours. I already have had one friend purchase this mug from Amazon after she saw mine.",positive,mug
It doesn't leak! I'm buying another!,positive,mug

"This travel mug is amazing! It kept my coffee hot for almost 8 hours, hot not warm! It is so worth the investment if you are looking for something durable, easy to clean, drip proof and keeps the hot hot and the cold cold!",positive,mug
"So much easier to clean than the other brand I used for several years. The button is a little stiffer to push in than other brands, but it's still a better mug.",positive,mug
"this travel mug is great for carrying hot or cold drinks in cars and does not require too much preconditioning like adding hot water before it keeps drinks hot, or adding iced water before it keeps cold drinks cold. You can pour the hot or cold drink right away. It will keep them at the temperature they are at, for a few hours. It saves a lot of time and hassle. Today, when everyone is on the go, all the time, especially.",positive,mug
I normally drink my coffee quick but I decided to take my time after buying this. I didn't do a test to see how long it would stay hot I just took a sip every 5 minutes or so until ran out. Took me 3 hours to finish and the coffee was still hot. Not warm but actually hot. As far water. I did do a cold test. from the time I started work to the time I finished (10 hours) this bottle actually kept my juice cold. I would HIGHLY recommend this,positive,mug
"easy to clean, bit heavy @ first",positive,mug

"I've had a Stanley classic trigger action travel mug for many years and finally lost it. I waited a couple of days to see if it turned up and was almost miserable without it. I think I may have loved it so much that I developed an emotional attachment to it. What's to love? It is absolutely leak proof; I could fill it with coffee, put it in my backpack, and never worry that it would leak no matter which way it ended up. The trigger mechanism, which is really more of a spring loaded push button, is easy to use and because it requires you to press it for each sip you take, that means the mug is automatically sealed again as soon as you've taken that sip. That is a beautiful feature because, unilke other travel mugs that are sealed until you open then to drink and then stay open until you close them, the Stanley trigger mug is going to re-seal and stay leak proof even if you knock it over by accident.Now, I will say that I bought one of the ""on sale"" mugs colors (happened to be black) and it arrived in a paper padded envelope with a few scuffs and minor dings. I wondered if it had been returned previously because of that or if they charge you less if they send it in a less protective manner. I didn't really mind because it will be dinged anyway after I use it for a few months and I plan to have this one for years and years, too, just like the last one. So, I took the seven bucks savings and doubt I'll ever notice the dings again.Bottom line: GREAT product!",positive,mug
Better than Contigo,positive,mug
Thank goodness it's REALLY leak proof bc I've dropped it my husband's dropped it and still not burned by his coffee easy to clean and his favorite feature is the lock top but you don't have to think about a pop top just push the button,positive,mug

Thanks Stanley, you highly functional tall drink of coffee.",positive,mug

"As a Junior High teacher who has spent their career in an environment of moderate sustained chaos, my preferred method of coffee intake is via IV drip. However, since my doctor has strongly advised against this, I have been forced to settle for consuming my caffeinated lifeblood from some form of drinkware.Enter this - the greatest coffee tumbler ever created, hands down.First of all, its fluid capacity is 20 ounces, not a measly 16. As such, your hands are virtually guaranteed to be shaking satisfyingly with caffeine overload by the time you're finished. And, regardless of whether you're a coffee slow-sipper, or a chug-the-liquid-fire-until-you've-scalded-every-last-taste-bud-in-your-mouth consumer, that coffee will be hot to the last drop. I'm not even kidding you, one day I filled this mug up at 6 am, drove to work, accidentally left it in the copy room before class like an absolute rookie, and didn't go back to pick it up until I had another break in the day - at 3:45 pm. The coffee inside was still hot. Not lukewarm, not bathwater warm. Hot.Another time, I left this mug sitting on my desk completely full, and it was accidentally knocked onto my laptop computer by a very apologetic student who was trying to make her way through our overcrowded classrooom with her backpack on. No computers were harmed on that day, because ""spill"" is not in this mighty mug's vocabulary.Initially the only moderate complaint I could find was that with the lid on, it's too tall to fit on the shelf at home with my other, lesser tumblers. And yet, its designers have anticipated my needs once again: the lid can be unscrewed, flipped over, and inserted back into the mug, shortening it by about 1/2 of an inch. Thus, now my other mugs can look upon its lidded form at night with envy and hang their subpar handles in shame because they are inferior, and they know it.So the next time a 7th grader rolls their eyes at me for asking them to do something completely unreasonable - like to stop running in a hallway while looking the other direction and also loosely swinging a school-issued iPad in their outstretched hand - I will take solace in knowing the next sip of my caffeinated beverage will still be satisfyingly hot. Thank you, designers of this mug. You the real MVPs.",positive,mug

Keeps my drink hot/warm most of the day. I only drink coffee with it. Very easy to clean unlike some of those other coffee mugs (contigo). Keeps my coffee hot for about 6 hours then starts to cool down but still keeps it warm for another 4 hours. Great size (20 ounces) because i love me some coffee!!!! 😬 would recommend.,positive,mug

"I have been searching for the perfect coffee mug for awhile. This is it because there isn't a gasket! Every mug I have had recently the gasket ring gets loose and the mug leaks. Finding replacement gaskets is impossible, so I ended up throwing away perfectly good mugs because of the gasket. This Stanley lives up to its brand name. There 2 two pieces to the lid. The enter piece is the button and it slides into the outer lid and locks in. That's it, no gasket. I have had 2 weeks now, without a drop spilling. It says real hot for about a few hours, don't think its the 9 hours I believe it states. Its 20 oz which is plenty for me and due to that size it fits into any cup holder. I am considering order a few for Christmas gifts.",positive,mug
"It doesn't leak and way easier to clean than I thought. Well worth buy. I think im sold on Stanley. Note, you can save on the big thermos at costco",positive,mug

"This is probably the best travel mug I've had! It is slim enough to be comfortable in my hand yet holds enough to keep me going for hours. The lead is the only really leakproof one I've found and it is easy to drink out of. The metallic paint is slightly textured so it is easy to hold on to, even if your hands are wet. Overall, I love this mug and would give it 6 stars if possible. I would definitely recommend it for hot or cold beverages",positive,mug
"Use everyday for work. I’ve dropped it from 6 feet directly on concrete more then a few times not on purpose lol. Still no leaks, stays cold for a 12 hour shift and warm/hot for 10-12hrs as well. Lid separates for easy clean. Highly recommend for purchase! When this one finally gives out I will have 1 being reordered instantly!!",positive,mug
This is a great coffee mug. It keeps your coffee hot for hours. It never leaks. The trigger took about 3 seconds to get used to pulling it when I want to drink. I also use this mug for cold water. It keeps the water cold for hours. Cleaning is really simple. Highly recommend this mug.,positive,mug
"Got this travel mug along with the small 20oz Stanley thermos and they seem to be a good pair for coffee on the commute and a few hours at work.I've had several Stanley thermoses and usually lose them or leave them somewhere before I wear them out. This mugs pretty much got the same construction, all metal and pretty sturdy and tough. Nice strong baked on hammered paint job and just feels solid in the hand, not light and flimsy like some.One of the best features is the way it seals like a thermos.. makes it where you can grab it up with a arm load of junk that's going to the car and not worry about spills. You can handle it like a thermos and throw it in a bag or wherever and it's convenient to not have to carry it carefully like an open cup. Also in my opinion completely sealing up keeps my coffee warmer way better and longer than any fancy brand that starts with ""Y"" and ends with an ""ETI"". I use my yeti at home on the weekends but this thing just makes way more sense for on the go. It's cylindrical narrow shape even lends itself to a cup holder anywhere.. fits in any cup holder. That same shape and size makes it no big deal not having a handle.. a handle hooks on stuff and gets in the way in some cup holders and it's just not needed on this narrow cup unless you're picky. It does take a little extra effort cleaning it although it's not a big deal to me. I'll just squirt a little shot of dish soap on it rub it around my hands under hot water press the button a few times to be sure moving parts are getting rinsed, shake it off a little and leave it in the sink to dry.. done -no big deal.So.. it keeps my coffee warm good, never spills, handle is never in the way or hanging up, fits any cup holder, button works easy and easy to drink from and it feels solid and bomb proof in my hand even though I know it's not. It's like a super tippy cup for adults and superheroes! Lol.I've used it for a few months now and I like it.I'm good with 5-stars.",positive,mug
"EXCELLENT product. Keeps items hot and cold, like all the high quality double walled stainless travel cups. But exceeds the rest in a few ways. Better than Yeti travel mug for a few reasons.First, it is truly leak proof. I lost my Yeti travel mug (not leak proof) and was looking for a leak-proof mug. This one is legit, even with fresh hot coffee and carbonated beverages.Second, liquids flow out of it generously, unlike some models that are like sucking a McDonalds shake through a straw. With the button pressed, the contents flow as they would from a seltzer can opening.Finally, it's fully cleanable. The top section unscrews from the can then easily unscrews within itself for convenient cleaning by hand or by dishwasher. You can have a protein shake in there and not worry about it drying up or leaving remnants.Super product.",positive,mug
This keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold better than any other container I've tried. It also has proven leak proof even when I throw it in my motorcycle travel bag and it gets shaken up and pressurized. It's super easy to take apart and clean as well.,positive,mug

"I've had this mug over a year now with frequent use and I can say it's the best travel mug I've had of many mugs over the years. I have always liked the classic Stanley thermos in green and this mug takes design queues from those, with a modern, functional design for the lid and mouthpiece. I haven't tested it for great lengths of keeping liquids hot, but for my daily needs of having a piping hot cup off coffee on the road, it does its job well and keeps it the same temp as when it went in until the last gulp.What I love most is the lid design. It doesn't leak or spill. When it's closed, it's really closed. You hold down the button and take a swig and it works perfectly. No dribbles. It could fall on the floor and it wouldn't leak. However, it probably wouldn't fall on the floor because it fits in the cup holder perfectly.At the end of the day, the whole assembly can be field stripped, cleaned, dried and put back together for another day of faithful service. This means you can get it really clean. No hidden schmutz in strange places. You can see all the parts and clean them accordingly.In terms of the strange taste others encountered...I didn't notice this. I did, however, dishwash the lid/mouthpiece before using it and cleaned the steel cup itself with hot soapy water. Sipping hot liquids through plastic isn't my favorite thing, but here, it seems like high quality plastic and with proper cleaning I trust it's ok. I highly recommend this mug!",positive,mug
"This is my favorite to go coffee cup.  I used it recently on a 4k mile road trip.  Kept my coffee hot, and not too big to fit in any cup holder.",positive,mug

Bought this as a Christmas present for my dad to replace the old travel mugs that he uses for work. He liked it so much that my siblings and I purchased like two more for his birthday and father's day. Super easy to clean and use.,positive,mug
We have bought 3 of these. They are durable and leak proof. My husband uses one for coffee and takes to work. It’s gets laid in lunch box and on seat and doesn’t leak. My grand daughter uses one for school and daycare. She is not so easy on it. It gets dropped and slammed. Hers has dents but is still working.,positive,mug
I bought my 20 oz. (591ml) about a year ago mainly for water and it's been great. It keeps water cold all day regardless of the heat. I can put four ice cubes plus water and it stays cold all day even with a refill. My only complaint is the push button for the valve requires a bit of strength to push. That's good because it seals really well but some who don't have the strength might find it hard to press. Other than that it's been perfect.,positive,mug
"I have discerning tastes and exacting requirements when it comes to travel mugs.  Leakproof is tablestakes.  Also needs to be relatively small diameter in the three inch range.  The mechanism to open the bottle needs the be easily operable with one hand and the cap has to unscrew with minimal force.  The parts need to be accessible and easily washed.  Lastly, it needs to look tight.  Nice color, professional, not too much bling but not cheap looking.  After leaving my 20oz miir travle mug with flip top in a cafe table during a trip to San Diego, I was in the market for a replacement.  I was never crazy about the Miir.  It met the leak proof, slim profile, and sleek look specs, but the flip top, when flipped up, left coffee stains on my nose after every sip.  Also, the cap was hella difficult to unscrew once finished.  The stanley scores big in all categories.  I really like the push button release which gives a perfect swallow of coffee with a quick press.  The cap easily disassembles for cleaning and the green hammered enamel paint is old school cred.  This is the one. Highly recommend.",positive,mug
Cumple con mis expectativas,positive,mug
I love this tumbler. It keeps your beverage very HOT for hours.  In fact often I use it without the lid for some time so my coffee can cool enough to drink.  It fits well in cup holders. The lid comes apart and is top rack dishwasher safe. When it is fully assembled very leakproof although might leak if jostled in a bag as the trigger could be depressed. I prefer a flip top on the lid so that you don’t have to squeeze the trigger for each sip but this is really a very high quality insulated tumbler and I would buy it again.,positive,mug
"Awesome travel tumbler. Fits in cup holders, doesn’t leak, and keeps my water cold and my coffee hot. Definitely buying more!",positive,mug

"I had never thought that a good thermos could change my life-that is until I had one. You see, back before my thermos, life was full of bleak despair. I could make all of the good strong coffee to keep a Kimball content when I was home-but what good was that when I couldn't take it with me? This would leave me with having to get up early, and rushing through the morning in hopes of having a piping hot mug of Java, chugging it so that I could leave on time to yell at other cars in my daily commute. It was this sprint-through routine, or having to settle for pond water (corporate coffee) once I had arrived at work, just to watch it pathetically cool down in it’s inferior styrofoam receptacle more and more each time I would have to answer my office phone.Now I don't have to settle. I have a good thermos. I can take my good coffee from home, sip it while yelling at drivers on my daily commute, and drink it throughout my day, remaining hot for it's entirety. I can fall asleep with coffee in my recliner, without having to worry about giving myself 2nd degree burns, and losing all of that precious dark roast. Now, I can toss my thermos in a backpack, or tackle box, or range bag, golf bag, fanny pack, or tool box, and be fueled for the day.How does that change my life though, you ask? You see, having a good thermos has made me want to get up earlier, because now I can be excited about good coffee on the work days. Now I can face anything, knowing I have a hot cup of coffee ready to go whenever I'm ready.If you're still trying to figure out gifts for the holidays, might I suggest getting the caffeine-deprived zombies in your life a good, rugged, reputable thermos? The model thermos I have was only $18 on Amazon, and will keep hot for so long, you could literally fill it up with a good roasted bean of coffee, wrap it as a gift, wait eight hours before giving it to your loved one, and it still might scorch their tongue. I can't think of a better gift for anyone who takes their coffee seriously.",positive,mug
"I've had the 20oz thermos for 2 years and it's held up great since the first time I got it.PROS- Keeps my coffee hot for at least 4 hours- Skinny design, but high capacity so it fits in all my cupholders and bike holders. Also more comfortable to hold and grip than a large thermos.- Durable! I have dropped this thing on concrete and sidewalks multiple times, not a dent or leak.- Convenient! The trigger system works and doesn't leak! I can actually shake the thermos and mix the contents.CONS/Need to Knows- Must be cleaned regularly: This goes without saying, but the the plastic top needs to be disassembled and cleaned on at least a weekly basis. Otherwise you get a build up of gunk and possible mold, the good news is that they made it very simple. You simply twist the plastic underside of the top and the entire trigger mechanism comes out. Running Some hot water and soap usually takes care of it, process takes about 10 seconds. Do not leave it sitting! If you leave it sitting with stale coffee and creamer you will need to get very hot water and scrub down the trigger mechanism and spring assembly.- Don't fill all the way up! I've made the mistake of filling the thermos all the way to the top or close to the top, if you try screwing the cap on it will overflow and make a mess. Leave at least an inch of space at the top so you don't run into an issue.All in All I rate this thermos a 10/10 to durability, simplicity and convenience.",positive,mug
"We have all sorts of vacuum sealed tumblers and mugs, and Stanley goes toe to toe with my now retired OXO. My coffee stays warm for about 5-6 hours, and cold drinks last even longer. I love the easy clean cap, bc you can remove stopper if you don't need leak proofing so you can put soda in it (so it doesn't blow the lid). The only thing is the white paint on this can be slippery, especially when wet. Either adding a grasping ring, rougher paint, or milling this would make it 110% in my book.",positive,mug
"I bought this to keep my grand babies water hot for making bottles while out. I had to go out for  5 hrs yesterday with her and she drink a 4oz warm bottle every 2 hrs. So I had bought this his to keep hot water in to add to 2oz room temp water bottles. Well it was put to the test, the water stayed hot all day and was even still the temperature she would normally drink it at this morning. So that’s from 9:30a.m. till 7:55a.m. the following morning! Now here is what I do to achieve this result! I boil water and pour over into this bottle while I’m boiling the babies water, when the babies water is done boiling I pour out the other water and add her water to this bottle and tighten the lid. On her 1st bottle which was less than an hour since I had boiled the water I had to pour only 1 oz hot water to 3 oz room temperature water.  Yes I know this could be considered to much, but you do what you have to do when dealing with a baby! Point is this stays hot all day!",positive,mug
I use it for coffee,positive,mug
The best part about this is the trigger action drink feature. Never have to worry about making sure it’s closed after a drink.,positive,mug

"I didn't expect it to keep the coffee this hot for so long.  I already have a popular pricey brand and this works easily as well keeping hot liquids hot.  I have not yet tried cold liquids yet, but given how well the Stanley works for coffee I see no issues at all.  But this one feels more solid than the pricey brand AND the lids seals tightly for travel on my bike",positive,mug

"I have went through dozens of travel mugs.  Cheap ones, expensive ones, and all in between.  Every Contigo I've owned has leaked eventually, and I was ready to give up on travel mugs.  Then along came this one.  It's a little tall at 20oz, but it fits beautifully in my cup holders of all my cars, and the trigger mechanism is easy to use, easy to clean, and doesn't leak a bit.I've seen some reviews about how the mechanism in the cap is easily broken when you take it apart, but it seems robust enough to me - it doesn't require any physical force to remove it from the cap, and maybe if you try to jam it in there or are rough with it, it might break or bend, but I can't realistically see how anyone could break this or muck it up.  It's that simple and easy.  Pull the mechanism out, rinse it, put it back in.  BOOM.It holds enough coffee for my commute, and it keeps hot beverages NUCLEAR HOT for a long time (I've never had coffee in it longer than 3-4 hours, but when I've drank it after that time, it's still piping hot.). This thing is built like a tank, it keeps your beverage hot or cold as you want it, it's easy to clean, and it's sexy.  (okay, it's as sexy as a retro looking coffee tumbler can look...). If you are fine with spending $10-20 for a Contigo or some other tumbler, spend the extra few bucks and buy this - it's the best tumbler around.",positive,mug
The only problem I've encountered in this Stanley thermos is you have to keep the plunger on the top clean so it doesn't leak. Other than that it keeps my tea or coffee hot for hours as I sip on it and then switch to iced coffee! This was a replacement for a 16 oz one that I had lost,positive,mug
"I've waited far to long to write this review, and it probably will go largely unnoticed, but it's worth the time because this mug is FANTSTIC. This is exactly what I have been looking for for a long time, and my family loves their as well!What drew me to this was the stainless steel construction, vacuum insolation, one hand simple opening to drink, reports that it doesn't leak, and durability, which I can verify is true for all.  Have routinely used this since I bought it.It does not leak . . .  at all.  I trust it filled and in my computer bag.  However, after sealing it there may be a small amount of liquid that stays where the liquid exits the cap, which I simply slurp up if I think it's needed (which is not very often).Biggest ""risk"" is over-tightening the cap and not being able to easily undo it later (after the mug cools down).  And, this mug keeps my coffee plenty hot enough for me for 5 or 6 hours.  And I have no issues squeezing the button to operate it. And while you drink/pour, I believe the air comes in around the button.Cleaning the lid and mug is harder than others describe.  Mug, just because it's deep, but similar to any other shaped mug.  Lid has a bunch more parts than described by others. It does disassemble to 3 sub-assemblies, but each of those has parts as well. I have not figured out how to disassemble the button yet portion yet, and that's what I feel is most needed.  So, when I'm doing a more thorough ""cleaning"" I end up soaking the 3 subassemblies in hot, soapy water, then scrubbing and rinsing all the parts thoroughly.  But for black coffee, a simple rinse seems to largely suffice.Well I think that's all the stuff it occurs to me to relate on the mug.  I've also have a Thermos Stainless-Steel Vacuum Insulated Bottle which is wonderful at keeping coffee hot and I use to refill through the day.  The pair make a great stainless steel combo!12/18/2017 Update.  Still loving the mug!  Have a bit of a process for washing it now, which I do roughly every few weeks (in addition to a simpler wash I do almost every morning).  I've been using the dishwasher tablets, dissolving that into ~ 1 gallon of very hot water, then filling the mug (and the referenced thermos) and letting them sit overnight without lids.  The lids I disassemble as much as possible and have worked out how to keep those submerged in the same soaping type of water.  This removes any buildups of coffee and everything looks sparkling clean.  Just be careful to fully rinse to avoid soapy flavors.",positive,mug
"Just buy it, keeps my coffee hot for 3 hours no need to prime the cup like I’ve read on reviews. The weird taste is there in the beginning so what I did was soak in soap water rinse and then added to boiling water for 30 seconds just like my baby bottles. Taste gone after second boiling",positive,mug
"Good quality, easy to use and optimal size",positive,mug
"I bought the Stanley hoping it would keep my coffee hotter than my Contigo mugs. I was not disappointed. It keeps coffee hot all day.I also did some temperature tests (with preheating) that confirmed this:0 hrs: Stanley 212 F; Contigo 212 F3 hrs: Stanley 176 F; Contigo 150 F5 hrs: Stanley 160 F; Contigo 129 F13 hrs: Stanley 125 F; Contigo 92 FI also looked at the Zojirushi travel mug, but decided against it because its lid looks like it would be somewhat awkward to drink from. For drinking, the Stanley lid is close to (but not as good as) the Contigo lid. Here, I do wish the Stanley lid's size was a little larger.But overall, I'm very happy with the Stanley.",positive,mug
"Mold will naturally accumulate in any container that isn't properly cleaned. Yes, you won't ever be able to thoroughly clean it, but I'm not sure what a lot of these people are drinking that seem to grow so much mold. If you're just drinking water or coffee, you'll be fine.",positive,mug

"Review: Great value and price. This stanley trigger thermos keeps my beverage hot and easy to access for sips during my long train commute ride. I make myself tea in the morning at 7am and this stanley thermos will keep my drink hot until 1-2pm (about 6-7 hrs). Then afterwards my drink stays warm for another 2 hours.Tips:Some reviews on here have critiqued the ""plastic smell"" when they first receive the item and also the longevity as well. I've found if you open the trigger mechanism inside the cap and wash the entire thermos along with the cap and trigger mechanism by hand, the plastic smell is washed away after the first/second use. And second, if you wash the thermos by hand regularly, you will increase its longevity as a thermos overall (use a long thin sponge or wash-wand). You can put it in the dishwasher from time to time (I do about once every 10 days). Also, some other reviews mention the leak from the mouth. This is actually an easy fix. Just take off the cap, unlock the inner trigger mechanism, and take it out for a second; then, put the trigger mechanism right back in the cap. The seal sometimes needs to lock back in place, thats it.",positive,mug
"EDITORS NOTE***Haven't tried out cold in this baby yet but rest assured when I do I will edit the review(12/19/2019)After performing thorough research on the right travel mugs/tumblers for long drives, my eyes came upon this gorgeous specimen.  While they have the original stanley green I opted for blue as blue is my favorite color.  I wasn't let down.  It is a gorgeous blue.  Gorgeous material.  Sleek and smooth.  That being said, let me try and answer some questions you may have about this baby.Does it keep it hot/warm?Yes.  My prime example was last month I drove the holiday 10 hours home to see my family.  I poured my coffee in the travel mug and also into my thermos.  The coffee was HOT for the first hour or so.  Not once during the time before refill(5 hours) did it get cold.  the mug manages to keep it very warm albeit warm enough to sip from.Today I filled the mug at 650 am.  It is now 1116am and the coffee is very warm.  A drinkable warm.Does it leak?Nope.  I have turned it over upside down in front of friends and co workers and she hasn't leaked once.  Was knocked off my desk at work by accident today and not only no damage but best of all no leaks!!!Easy to clean?Yes.After every use just unscrew the cap then unscrew the trigger mechanism from the the cap and bam! wash that baby off and wash out your mug.It also fits quite comfortably and snugly in my cup holders and I happen to think it also looks fashionable.  I have had my Stanley thermos for over 10 years now and I hope I will have this travel mug for years!!!Totally recommend it.  Get if for someone as a gift and you won't go wrong!",positive,mug
"Sleak, clean design.  Stainless band around the top robs the right amount of heat of my coffee to warm my grip without cooling off the coffee.  Would definitely buy again.  Upside down - No problem!",positive,mug
These Stanley mugs are the only thing I'll use for transporting my coffee. There's no comparison when it comes to keeping my coffee hot all day! When I saw this new color I had to have it (I own 4 others) This one is more of a feminine dusty rose color than the stock image shows. I couldn't be happier. Recommend 10 otta 10!,positive,mug
"I am a person who is away from home sometimes from 8am until 9:30pm so I needed a handheld mug that actually did what it said and honestly, this may just be my best purchase ever. If you're looking for a handheld mug that truly keeps liquids hot for hours (or cold for hours), this is it.I had this filled up at 2pm by a barista at Starbuck's with a hot beverage. I was supposed to have the inside heated with water before adding the hot beverage so that the beverage doesn't cool down from the cold sides, but when you show up with a container that is 20 oz on the inside, but looks 40 oz on the out (it's slim, but tall), you just hold it out and ask for your drink. At 9pm, it was still warm. Mind you, it wasn't piping hot, but just hot when I took my first sip at 2.I dropped this a couple times, maybe a few is a better, more truthful way to go. It also arrived in a plastic envelope (what's with Amazon packaging lately?) with no padding and who the hell knows what the UPS guys do with their packages. From the looks of the bag, a lot of drop kicking, BUT the Stanley mug was undamaged.I washed it, dried it, packed it, had it filled, then proceeded to fall in love with it.The reason for the pic? I dropped it in bed (not because I'm in love with it and couldn't bear to part with it, but because I still had a hot beverage at bedtime to drink) and immediately did an out loud ""OH SHIZZZ"" for my Ralph Lauren blanket (another reasonably priced great purchase), but it didn't leak. Then, because I'm made this way, I threw it to the other side of the bed. Still didn't leak. So, I held it off the side of the bed and started shaking it upside down like an ape ... no leak still.  It's startling because I mean not one drop leaked and if you're part of the travel mug brigade, you know all about leaks and spills.So, for $21.04 with free shipping, I got something that has a lifetime warranty, is hammerstone (lovely word for retro pea) green, has one thumb opening at the top, yet seals when you take your thumb off, is klutz proof, and by everything I can find, a better deal than Yeti and RTIC. Worth it!This is far superior to anything I've used and everything it competed against for the win, including Yeti and RTIC!",positive,mug

I needed new camping bottles and most of my other camping gear was already StanleyBrand- I was happy with how sturdy it was and lived the like a glove fit in my unique ford maverick door.

"I do tree work. I wanted a cup that auto closes, and doesn’t have too many spots to collect dirt on top. We cut all winter. Those mug works even with gloves on. Sometimes a little coffee and sawdust are on the rubber stopper thing, but one quick blow and it’s fine. Coffee stays hot long enough I really only use this in the cooler months. If you sip you’re coffee all day instead of slamming it, you’d probably enjoy this thing year round.Also; the lid breaks down and reassembles for cleaning pretty easily. So that’s good, too.",positive,mug

"I was looking for something that was:1) Able to keep coffee hot for 8 hours2) Dishwasher safe3) BPA free4) Leakproof travel sipping lidI also bought a Yeti Rambler with the Hot Shot Cap to compare directly to and keep the better product.1) Is a must - I make coffee the night before and leave very early for fishing.  The goal is to not wake up anyone in my house as I leave EARLY.  Making coffee smells good but wakes people up.  So I needed something I could fill the night before and keep my coffee hot 8 hours later.  Verdict: The Stanley kept the coffee hot and the Yeti was like warm.2) Gotta be dishwasher safe, I’m not into hand washing when I get home from fishing and have 50 other things to clean and put away.  Both products are marketed as dishwasher safe.3) Both products are marketed as dishwasher safe, and I did not get any aftertaste from either.4) The Trigger Action Stanley works as advertised and is easy to drink from while driving.  Best of all it’s LEAK PROOF.  The Yeti failed in this regard.  It’s a pain to twist the Hot Shot Cap open/close and you have to get it really tight - but even then it leaked.  Don’t know if it’s the Rambler or the Hot Shot Cap but two different times I slobbered coffee on my shirt.Bottom line:  I was very surprised but the Yeti lost this contest.  Stanley fits what I want perfectly - and it’s less than half the price.  Call me impressed 👍",positive,mug

"Based on reviews, one in particular of a self-described travel mug collector, we bought two of these vacuum mugs, one 16 oz and one 20 oz. in navy and copper (both lovely colors). This is by far the best travel mug available on the market, although the Coleman Element 5 (no longer available) deserves an honorable mention for use in my field backpack when hunting.Just like their thermoses, the Stanley Classic One Hand Vacuum Mug keeps hot beverages hot for hours, literally. I have sipped coffee after 8 hours that was still somewhere between warm and hot. Coffee never lasts that long for me but I had gotten distracted with work that day. One note of caution: be careful with the plastic lid. I knocked a partially full mug off of the counter and the wing on the side of the lid broke off leaving a jagged edge. It is very durable, but hitting the floor from counter height damaged it slightly. Also be careful when washing the lid components. We managed to lose the small seal that keeps the mug sealed shut when the button is not pressed in to drink. More on that below...Stanley customer service remains top notch too, after all of these years. As mentioned, we lost the small seal in the lid mechanism on one of our mugs. I emailed customer service asking if a replacement was available for purchase. After all, we lost it, we will gladly pay for a replacement we just need the seal or a whole new lid. Sure enough, the seal was available and Stanley sent us a new one free of charge!Build quality is the same we long time Stanley thermos owners are accustomed to. Mind you, the imported items made over the past couple of decades are not as good as the old days when they were still made in the USA, but they still function very well.  I remember stories of a couple of my dad's friends who had damaged their thermoses and Stanley replaced them free of charge even though they were responsible. One drove over his with a bull dozer and gouged the side but it still kept his coffee hot. After years of using the thermos in that condition he finally contacted Stanley and they sent him a brand new one. My dad had a rare dud that he fought with for a few years but it just wouldn't keep things hot so they sent him a new one as well.",positive,mug
I bought this to hold my hot tea and it is the perfect size for one tea bag. I have dropped it a lot and it is very sturdy it has a few dents now but it hasn't lost its vacuum insulation at all. It is very easy to hold. It doesn't leak at all and it holds heat very well and keeps things cold for a long time as well. The top has a very convenient mechanism for pulling it apart to clean it. The mechanism is hard to clean well so I soak it in vinegar and then it is clean as a whistle.,positive,mug
Great thermos. Keep things hot for a few hours. Weight feels great,positive,mug
"I have used this product nearly every day for 2.5 years and it finally has developed a crack in the plastic that has caused a very slow leak.  I am not upset one bit because I have abused this mug and it has zero dents and only one 1.5cm area where the ""paint"" has come off of the bottom...robust is what I would call this product.  I am buying another one today without hesitation.  Is it perfect, no.  I don't know what perfect would look like in a realistic world, but I can say this thing is as close to perfect as I have seen myself and I am willing to pay out another 25 bucks for a product that lasted almost 1000 days of use before breaking.",positive,mug
Fits in car cupholder. High quality as expected with Stanley products.,positive,mug
"Love this travel mug.  Fits nicely in beverage holder in my car.  Comfortable to hold.  Does exactly as promised.  Hot drinks kept hot.  Cold drinks kept cold.  While closed, I accidently knocked it over and no leaks.Had a nasty cold and poured hot soup (Homemade chicken broth) in around midnight.  Sipping it throughout the night.  Remained warm until noon..  Love when I buy something and it works the way it is supposed to.  We have purchased and use quite a few Stanley products for many years.  A+ for all.",positive,mug

"I take this to work each morning full of hot coffee. I work in a classroom of kindergarteners; it is has been knocked over, dropped from a filing cabinet, and it still looks as good as it did when I purchased it. It doesn't leak so I don't have to worry about messes or kiddos getting burnt. The best part is... My coffee is still hot at the end of the school day! Oh and I love how easily it comes apart to clean too!! Definitely a purchase you won't regret!",positive,mug

I love the color choices (I have green and black). The best thing is it is leakproof!,positive,mug
"This is the only bottle/thermos I've ever owned that is actually leakproof. I can literally throw it in my bag, and not worry about it spilling at all. I have a zulu straw one for water, but I can't put coffee in that.. this is my favorite one for coffee. It also keeps my coffee cold for hours! At the end of the day if I still have some, I end up pouring ice out of my thermos. I will be buying more, in more colors. It's also east to clean, and fully comes apart for really good cleaning. Goes back together easy too.",positive,mug
"Hands down the BEST travel coffee mug I’ve ever used.  Why?  3 big reasons.1.  Liquid will only pour from the spout when the spring loaded button is depressed.  The second you relax your finger, the spout will close.  This minimizes accidental spills.  The second the mug leaves your hand, the spout closes.  If you drop this mug, the opening will snap closed well before it ever hits the ground.2.  There is a substantial lip around the opening where you sip from.  This is a very important detail that many travel mugs do not have for some reason.  This lip/spout allows you to slowly sip your piping hot coffee without burning your lips.  The hot coffee will pool into this lip and you are free to sip (or slurp as I do).  Without this lip/spout, the hot coffee would pour from the opening and directly onto your lips.3.  This travel mug is plenty sturdy.  It’s fallen from the roof of my car while pulling out from the driveway and it only got a few cosmetic scratches.  I’ve also run it over in a John Deere gator vehicle and it scuffed up the paint, dented the bottom edge, and even  chipped part of the lid.  The mug still performs flawlessly- no leaks at all.I proudly use my scratched and dented, yet still working, Stanley mug daily.",positive,mug
I always trust Stanley products. I am very happy with this one.,positive,mug
"This cup keeps my coffee hot for hours, I make coffee at 630 am every morning and usually am done drinking it by 8, however on some days I am so busy I don't get around to actually drink my coffee until later. Like noon later. My coffee will still be hot. It's amazing.Easy to carry, very easy to wash the cup but the part you actually drink from can be a bit difficult to thoroughly clean.",positive,mug
"Ordered the stainless steel one and got it on Thursday before Christmas.  Tried it out with hot chocolate that night and coffee the next morning.  Both times, the liquid stayed satisfactorily hot. Very pleased with it. Its nice that i don't have to drink my coffee very fast now because it stays hot longer. Looking forward to using it on our road trip for Christmas.UPDATE: used it on our road trip for Christmas to New Mexico, Arizona and Texas. Worked great! Very happy with it!",positive,mug
My husband wanted me to get him a travel cup for the road. He was dead set against a metal cup because of previous cups he had tasting like metal. I got him this and he loves it. No metal taste and it keeps his precious coffee hot all night.,positive,mug
"I always buy Thermos mugs. When the lid is in the closed position, it can be knocked over with no spilling unlike a popular, more expensive brand. It also kept my hot drinks hot for longer than that same competitor. I wish there were even more colors!",positive,mug

"After reading recent reviews on this, I'm compelled to take a moment to relay my pleasure with this product, and counter some of the reported downsides.First:  Apparently the marketing dept. actually listened, and they aren't using the terrible stickers from Hades to cover the outside of the cup any longer.  They are now using the brittle shrink-wrapped plastic, with a perforation down the side (similar to what is used on those glass-bottle cold coffee drinks from that major coffee chain, or some ice cream lids, or some vitamin bottles) , which made it easy to take off the outside advertising.  Heck, even the two UPC codes on the bottom of the cup practically came off like old-school colorforms - zero residue.I ordered the plain stainless steel one, so I can't comment on the paint chipping/peeling issues some noted (sure, it might be quality control, or maybe it's exacerbated/caused by dishwasher detergents?).  I can say that mine came without a dent or scratch on it.  Maybe I'm lucky?  I'm sure I'll put some on it soon anyway, since I'm a bit clumsy (and why, apart from this mug, I just can't have nice things).The handle seems plenty sturdy, and yes, the internals on the lid have a few extra pieces.  Taking the lid apart to wash and putting it back together is fairly easy, and the opening on the lid lines up 90 degrees from the handle.  While it's certainly possible some lids might be defective/improperly aligned/mated, it appears more likely to me that maybe some folks aren't tightening the lid just right?.  I can't argue against the folks that are having problems; I can just state that mine is easy to align and the sipping hole is where it should be when the lid is fastened casually/normally.Making sure the lid is 'open' prior to screwing it on seems to help minimize any chance of overflow, or resistance while tightening the lid.  On mine, it does not remotely require Herculean effort to tighten or remove the lid to have the drinking hole line up properly, and the lid be leak-free.I use my cup daily, and since my last one (different brand) lasted well over 10 years, this mug appears built well and should last at least that long (but it's nice that it has a 5 year warranty, just in case).",positive,mug
"My previous travel mug, also of the same make and model, was getting a bit worn, and needed a replacement. I did not hesitate to order the same one from Thermos/Amazon. The only difference this time is a plain stainless steel exterior, which I think is far superior to my previous mug in Midnight Blue, which chipped and scratched easily.Doesn’t splash, doesn’t leek, holds my coffee or tea’s temps for hours. And the handle makes it easy to carry. Easy to clean too, which is a plus.Helpful hint: the interior and other internal parts will eventually get stained. Do not use chlorine bleach, or any cleaners that contain bleach. It will damage the steel. Use denture cleaning tablets instead. They may need a few hours of soaking, but you can rest easy knowing there will be no chemical damage done. Avoid abrasive cleaners as well. These can scratch the surfaces and cause increased staining.",positive,mug
Keeps my coffee hot for hours,positive,mug
"After leaving my original one in a hotel room, I tried to go cheap with another brand. But it fell short in so many ways that I ended up ponying up the ridiculous price for this one. It keeps coffee hot forever, it does in just about any cup holder, the handle is convenient, and I like that you can disassemble it to give it a thorough cleaning in the dishwasher. It is unfortunate that it is about $15 too expensive, but they do what they do better than anyone else.",positive,mug

"This is an awesome mug, doesn't leak, easy to clean, and holds the liquid hot for hours. You may want to watch a couple of you-tube channels to see how to clean the lid because it has to be taken apart i order to clean. But it's easy once you know how. One thing to be aware of, is that you want to be sure how hot your liquid is before you fill your mug. I made the mistake of filling it with hot coffee the first time I used it and burnt my mouth, there is no way to blow on it in the mug. Another thing that a lot of reviewers mentioned was the stickers on the mug left glue on after trying to remove them. Well Thermos must have read some of them because the one I got had a sticker that was heat shrunk to the mug and it came off with no glue left because there was no glue on the stickers. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good mug to carry hot liquid for a time. I hang it on my snow blower when its 20f out and it stays hot.",positive,mug
"This is my second one, same style. My first one lasted several years until I dropped it and the handle broke off. I immediately ordered another one just like it. It keeps beverages hot for a long time. Wide enough to reach the bottom for cleaning. Handle is handy when carrying several items. Highly recommend.",positive,mug
"I’ve got a couple of the good Thermos cups that I use. They keep my cold drinks cold for hours. Hot drinks stay hot for anywhere from 3-5 hours. Way better than that high priced brand that so many people think is so good. I know because we have those, too.I bought this particular Thermos for my husband, who is extremely picky about his coffee containers. I bought him the more expensive brand. He thought it was too heavy. It didn’t keep his coffee warm very long. It wouldn’t fit in his truck cup holder. You get the idea. I didn’t try this Thermos cup for him because I’d read a few reviews that said the handle came off. However, after listening to his repeated complaints and knowing how much I like my Thermos cups, I decided to go ahead and get it. His only complaint now is that his coffee stays too hot. He has to add a couple ice cubes to it so he can drink it.A couple bits of advice: you’ll see Thermos cups that are sold as a package and are cheaper. Read the details. You’ll find they’re not the higher quality ones. Also, if you’re not picky on colors, check the price on a variety of colors on this cup. Some colors are cheaper than others.This is well worth the money you’ll spend for it.",positive,mug
"I've had this cup for about 6months now and it is simply amazing!!!!The cup is lightweight and easy to carry around. Keeps my tea insanely hot all day long!!! I will fill this cup with tea at 7am and at 6pm I still have to sip with caution - and yes - I did say SIP with caution!!!!Easy to clean, fairly easy to pull apart for a deep clean and easy to store.The only drawback I could find is that it does not sit well in my car's cupholder. It keeps bouncing in the space as the base of the cup is a whole lot smaller than the space provided for in my car. But in all honesty - I am nitpicking!",positive,mug
You really can't go wrong with this product! I love it!,positive,mug
Your coffee will stay hot for hours. I’ve been using this for 5 years and loving it. I’m ordering another one because I dented mine (stored ice in it and banged it to get ice out) and it wobbles now. One problem:  sometimes the cap will spin while trying to take off. I usually put it in the fridge for a bit and it opens but it’s annoying. Other than that it’s perfect!!Tip:  before you put the lid on have it at the temperature you drink it. You will burn your tongue and it will never cool off once the lid is on. It stays hot!! Love my mug.,positive,mug
I bought same brand years ago and it kept my cold drinks cold with ice for almost two days. Your drink does not become watery/ diluted. Love this brand!,positive,mug
"This is one of the better mugs I've tried. Not sure what some of the reviews are saying about the top leaving the opening in the wrong spot for drinking for right handed people. Maybe Thermos listened and fixed the issue, but mine aligns perfectly. (I used an earlier version of a Thermos mug (see pic) on my desk in the morning for years, and I considered it the best mug I ever found. It was before everything had to be made for car cup holders, so it was wider on the bottom, which made it perfect as spill proof on my desk... If anyone at Thermos knows where I can get one of these, please let me know... I don't think they make it anymore...) Anyway, this new one is great, keeps coffee hot for hours.",positive,mug
                    The media could not be loaded.                 It is 100% leak proof and I can safely carry this mug in the bag.,positive,mug
"fits well in car cup-holder.  Feels substantial and really like that it has a handle.  A lot of small parts to remove to do a thorough cleaning; be careful not to let any go down the drain.  Seals really well, retains temperature very well.  Printing for instructions was so small I had to use a magnifying glass (and I don't need reading glasses for anything else). Holds a full 16 oz even with the lid on (disappointed in a mug (Not this brand) that I just bought that advertised 16 oz, but only hold 14 with lid on).",positive,mug
"We have these both in the house and in our travel trailer, and we love them!Pros:1. Hot coffee stays hot to warm for hours.2. Iced liquids stay cold and still have ice after hours.3. The lid doesn't spill easily when it is properly closed.4. Lightweight and it doesn't break.5. Fits into cup holders in the car and our folding camping chairs.CONS:1. The lid has to be taken apart to really clean it, but the design keeps the cup from spilling easily and creates the needed insulation to keep the liquids hot or cold. It is worth the extra work to clean it.2. The lid can seal too tightly and be hard to twist off.3. The opening for drinking is never quite in the right place, so when drinking, it is necessary to be careful.  Despite the requirement for care, the design of the lid is worth it.",positive,mug
"I bought first thermos five years ago when I was a truck driver and it's still alive! And it does what it's supposed to do- holds the temperature perfectly. I often made hot coffee or tea before I went to bed and the next morning it was still hot (depending where I left it of course, in the sleeper or in the cab). Even when you drop it and make a dent it makes no harm to the structure and still functions great. The only thing that bothered me was the paint. I bought black for me and red for my wife. They got scratched within a year or so but only because we dropped them a lot.Now I'm a business owner and I am buying stainless steel ones for my new truckers as a welcome gift. They get impressed because it is way different from what they can find.Don't believe those who say the handle breaks itself or under it's own weight! It's sturdy! The only inconvenience I found is cleaning it inside. The thermos is too deep and narrow for my hand and I had to find a tool to scrub it.I love the way I can disassemble the cap. Cleaning it is THE pleasure! The rubber parts darken within a year or so depending what you drink but they sell replacements so it's not a problem at all.Overall- 5.5 stars!",positive,mug
Totally lives up to their claim. After 7 hours the coffee is still hot and fresh tasting.,positive,mug
"Although a bit heavy, this thermos does what it claims.  I like ice cubes in my water, and this thermos keeps them ""alive"" for HOURS.",positive,mug
"This is the best travel mug I have used. The shape is perfect, the handle is comfortable and serves as a belt hook, it never leaks, and it keeps hot liquids hot for a very long time. Some reviews indicate difficulty screwing on the plastic lid to the steel body but it is a nuts & bolts matter of lining up the threads. I've used mine almost daily for 16 months. Two things keep it from being perfect and they could easily be solved by the company.First is the glued on labels. Stick on labels should be easy to pull off but these required a lot of work to remove.Second, the stamped sheet metal handle mount is spot-welded to the body of the mug. Then, the plastic handle is fastened with a stainless steel screw. So far, so good. The spot welds that hold the handle mount to the body of the mug are not large enough. Over months of normal use, the handle mount fatigues and eventually falls off. This is also easily solvable by the company. A larger handle mount with larger spot welds is needed to make sure the welds don't yield under normal use and eventually fatigue. Mine failed after 16 months. Fortunately the mug is under a 5 year warranty.",positive,mug
"The lid is awful. Very hard to clean and put back together. And hard to take off and on. I also don’t like the flow of the lid. You can’t tell when the liquid is coming out. Also, there is nothing to grip on the lid. Very difficult to get off.",positive,mug

"Purchased one for a gift - recipient said it was the best mug she ever had. So I bought myself one, which I originally considered when I saw the size - jeez, I could fit two cups of coffee in it (6 oz strong each with lots of cream). She wasn't kidding - the coffee stays hot for several hours. I love the fact the lid screws on, as all the other ones I've had the lid just pushed on (including much more expensive ones). I once hit my brakes with one of the push-on lid cups in the drink holder and ended up with coffee all over my console and floor. That wouldn't happen with this cup, as the screw on lid and the ""closed"" position of the top makes it leak-proof. A client commented to me about a week ago, ""that's a really nice mug, does it keep your drink hot or cold?"" I could only answer about the hot part, as I bought it strictly for hot coffee, but the answer was an emphatic YES. Great price too. Highly recommend.",positive,mug

I was looking for a leak-proof travel mug that would fit in a car cup holder and actually keep the coffee hot. This does all of that! The handle is a nice bonus and makes it easy to drink from. I also really like the lid -- it's easy to lock closed with one hand. Would definitely recommend!,positive,mug
"The lid and sealing mechanism is outstanding. No chance of a leak and it keeps coffee very hot for 4+ hours. The handle is very nice for carrying even with 1 finger. Only negative is because the seal is so good, it can be difficult to get completely clean. I would strongly recommend.",positive,mug

"I bought this is silver which was not a 'shiny finish'.  Some of the other colors are very pretty.  I love that it fits in my console very well.  The 16 ounce capacity is a good enough size for that large drink.  Have never used it for a cold drink, but it keeps my coffee hot (not just warm) all day long!  I especially love the handle.  You can grab it when your hands are already full of other things.  I sometimes hang it on things just to get it out of the way. (I open a drawer and hang it on the edge of the drawer front just to keep it from getting knocked over if it's sitting on a busy surface.  It seals up tight!  No spills ever, although with very hot coffee, you will want to turn it to 'open' briefly to keep it from getting too much  vacuum built up.Would definitely buy again for myself or as gift for a 'traveling drinker'.",positive,mug

I was so excited when I saw I can still purchase the exact same one. This lasted me 10 years - that's basically just $3 a year for this high quality product. Well worth the price. Very durable - very rough with it but it holds together like a champ. Keeps hot drinks hot for at least half the day and cold drinks stay at the very least relatively cold the majority of the day. Great product.",positive,mug

"I've had this mug for over 8 months. The Contigo mug I'd had for years wasn't keeping my coffee as hot anymore, so I went looking for a replacement. I'm not a commuter, but I am a coffee sipper, so I want my coffee to be hot for a couple of hours, at least. This Thermos mug does exactly that.I also like the handle because it makes the mug easy to hold. Yesterday I found a new advantage to the handle: I fell recently and have to use a walker. The handle is the perfect fit for the front rail of my walker.The lid was quite stiff when I got the mug, but it screws on easily now. More than once, I've tipped the mug over and it has been absolutely leak proof. I like this mug!",positive,mug
"This is a replacement mug. Because rhe one my husband loved was scratched, dented&  beat up horrifically over the last 5 years. This is a super easy to clean and leak proof mug.

My husband dropped his original mug off a roof while he was shingling and dented the lid. The handle was loose and it still kept beverage hot and didn't leak. This mug will take a whole lot of abuse and still function.",positive,mug

Love the tight vacuum seal and easy to use lever. Cleaning isn’t hard either.I got a Yeti for Christmas and was disappointed that it didnt keep my liquids hot/cold as long as this mug. Definitely not all they are cracked up to be.Highly recommended this mug and can’t say enough good things about it!",positive,mug
"This is a great Thermos, as would be expected!  I got it for someone who had back surgery and is using a walker.

"This was my second thermos mug that i purchased, my first lasted me several years. I love how it keeps beverages hot for a hours. If you keep the lid closed in between sips it prolongs this. You can take apart the lid easily and clean it. The base is skinny enough to fit in any cup holder but sometimes the handle can get in the way....nonetheless i recommend this handled version!",positive,mug
Kept my drink hot hours,positive,mug
"Oh my goodness! I was really hesitant to spend this much money on a mug BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!  I came out after work and my morning coffee is still hot! In the closed position it you can hold it upside down and will not leak!  In the open position the opening is small enough that if you leave it open in the car cup holder then curves and bumps will not make it slosh out onto your pants. It is heavy; this is no wilting flower, so everyday bumps or drops will not damage it.My only complaint - and it is pretty minor - is that the openings do not line up with your mouth well.  If they fixed that I don’t know how you could possibly make a better mug- as it stands it is by far the best mug this long morning commuter has ever owned!",positive,mug
My wife bought me this mug for Christmas to replace an old painted Thermos mug that was worn with the paint peeling off.  This mug keeps my coffee hot for hours as did the old one.

"I simply love this mug. It keeps my coffee hot all day if I forget about it. We use these mugs when traveling , and keeping your expensive espresso hot until you finish it, is well worth it.Much easier to keep clean than previous models ,I disassemble almost every night to place in the dishwasher. Removal of the gaskets is simple.Customer service is top notch , when I lost my kid while traveling.Only minor complaint is that the open and close labels wear off quickly.Just remember “Left open” ... if the lever is on the “left” of the mouthpiece it’s “open”",positive,mug

This is the best travel mug I've owned. I've had various brands and worked in manufacturing over 50 years. Instead of water I drank coffee. This mug was the only one that kept my coffee hot. I'm retired now and the coffee is still drinkable several hours later. not luke warm. I like stainless steel and will purchase it first. I have owned others that are painted. NEVER BOUGHT PLASTIC!!,positive,mug
"I bought two of these and we use them daily. My coffee stays so hot, I have to add a little water to it so I can drink it on my 50 minute commute, otherwise it stays too hot to drink!We also use them when we are working outside and it stays hot, even though we live at 9,800 ft. in the Rockies. It's nice to have hot coffee when it is 20 below 0!I have not had any problems with either of them leaking and we just open the valve on the lid and put the whole thing in the dishwasher. Super easy and convenient. Very happy!",positive,mug
I am really impressed with their no leak design which includes a screw on lid. It also trims down to fit in my automobile cup holder. Keeps my coffee piping hot to the last drop every time. You won't be disappointed with this Thermos mug.,positive,mug
This mug does keep your coffee hot for as long as it lasts. Good size.,positive,mug
"I've been on a quest to find a travel mug that kept drinks hot (or cold) for long periods, would not leak, and would fit in my cup holder. I bought a Contigo, which works very well, but this one is even better. The handle doesn't interfere with it fitting in my cup holder, you can drink from either side of the cup when it's open so it doesn't matter if you are right or left handed, it keeps my coffee hot even when I have the cover on ""open"", and it allows a reasonable amount of liquid to drink while not pouring so much you burn yourself. I wasn't sure about the handle, but I really like having a handle.",positive,mug
Keep coffee warm for a long time!,positive,mug
"These are really great mugs - hot things stay HOT for hours. Definitely don't spill. Super easy to clean as the top comes completely apart and I just bought replacement parts for my husband's mug, which he has had for at least four years. Have one for everyone in the house and I love the varied colors - it is so easy to distinguish everyone's.",positive,mug
Great for coffee with the handle,positive,mug
"Wanted a 16 oz. thermal cup that fit in the cup holders in my cars, with a handle (to hang on grocery carts).  Had another version that had a on/off button on the top, but you couldn't tell if it was on or off.  Spilt coffee on myself many times.  The coating on that cup peeled off over time, also.  This cup has a slide switch with the words OPEN/CLOSE so there is no doubt if it is closed.  This cup is the only one of all the 16 oz. Thermos cups on Amazon with this feature, and was hard to find from the pictures and descriptions.",positive,mug
"es muy práctico su uso, fácil de llevar, buen tamaño, y no deja escapar el liquido. Ah, y da status 😁",positive,mug
I am a repeat customer.  This is a great product!  The lid seals well and has been leak proof so far.  The handle makes it easy to hold.  It fits in the car beverage holders with no problem.  The hot liquids stays hot for 5 hours.  I have been putting the cup and lid in the dishwasher and all parts get clean and sanitized. Thermos has lasted longer than other brands we have tried.,positive,mug
"We ordered three of these to replace some aging travel mugs.  We've been really happy with a) the fact that they don't leak---at all.  If it's leaking, it's likely because the parts were not correctly assembled, b) it keeps the liquids HOT, c) it's easy to clean and put back together (we hand wash to keep the vacuum feature in tact).  We've had no problems with the handles or the spout.  Highly recommend.",positive,mug
Hubby had this mug before for a few years. I believe over the years it sprung a leak. He wanted the same thing for Christmas. He was very happy to have his favorite mug again.  Keeps his coffee nice and hot until the last drop.,positive,mug

This is the best coffee cup I've bought. I can leave it for an hour or so and it's still hot.  Will buy another one.,positive,mug
"The only thing I dislike is when the lid is screwed on tight, the drinking hole is off center when u hold it to drink, but we loosen it a little to line up....it's ok...we love it anyway! Thank u",positive,mug
"Excellent mug, keeps my coffee hot all day. Even when camping in near freezing temperatures a hot cup filled up before bed will still be hot, not super hot, but good to drink by morning.  Be careful of the handle though if knocked around to much the handle may loosen even a little bit and break the vacuum. still pretty durable lasted nearly a year or more of daily use and abuse carrying around hanging on my belt and being thrown around a truck. No leaks as long as you remember to close the sipping hole.",positive,mug
"This thermos seems to be holding up after top rack dishwashing (has probably been washed a dozen times now) My husband and my criteria for a thermos is number one priority: can go in dishwasher. Number two would be that yes it does keep beverages warm but since I drink my beverages within an hour, I can't  say how long it does so. When you wash the lid in the dishwasher it will drip a lot of water when you remove it so just shake it out over the sink first before storing.",positive,mug
Keeps your hot drinks hot for hours. Really a great travel mug. Defiantly recommend!,positive,mug
Expensive. Good quality.,positive,mug
"I am stunned!  The travel cup is the buy of a lifetime.  I poured at cup at 6:30 a.m., and 12 hours later, my coffee is still warm.  Easy to pour, easy to drink from, what more could I ask for?  Buy it!",positive,mug
"I like this mug.  It fits in my car holder well.  I have the stainless steel color - it is easy to clean, and holds the temperature amazingly well for several hours.",positive,mug
"Husband likes his new cup. It replaced the same one he had in black that lasted about 5 years before the paint all chipped away and the handle got wiggly. Hoping this one lasts even longer, but the big plus is that there is no paint to chip away!By the way, a search online indicated this is a bit overpriced on amazon but I think it was worth it for the convenience of prime shipping.",positive,mug
I walk at 4:45 AM and the mug comes with.  This was a replacement and has surpassed its predecessor in every way imaginable.  Handle makes it easy to carry on long walks.  Not heavy.  Easy to drink from and closes.  It's 1:15 PM and my coffee is still hot.  Fits easily in the drink holder in my truck.  I'd recommend this product to anyone without reservation.,positive,mug
"I really like the heat holding factor, stays hot for a really long timealso is lightweight, easy to carry around.",positive,mug
Works extremely well with hot or cold and compared to inherent overpriced cups like ones that start with a Y its a Great Value,positive,mug
This is the best thing I have ever had for a travel mug . It keeps my coffee hot for a long time. I have a 40 min drive to work and now my coffee is still hot when I get there!

Love my cup,positive,mug
"I have three of these thermoses.  The most recent one I got is just the stainless steel (silver/ no color added) one.  It is perfect! They keep my coffee hot until I am able to finish it at work (sometimes hours after making it).If you purchase a colored one, the color chips away after multiple washes. It then looks cheaply made; HOWEVER, it still works great for all intended purposes.  I would go with just the stainless steel, no color added one.",positive,mug
"I ordered black, but Red came.I ordered white together. It's like a set. ThankU.^^*The tumbler had to be cleaned with abrasives without exception.",positive,mug

I got this for my husband to take his coffee to work in . He loves it. Very good quality!,positive,mug
"I have been using this mug for a few month now and can say it is this best travel mug I have ever used. It is easy to drink from, keeps my coffee nice and warm until the last drop, which takes from 5 to 8 hours, I just sip the coffee. The trick is to fill it with hot water and let it set for a few minutes before filling with coffee and close the lid when not drinking from mug. I highly recommend this mug for your coffee mug.",positive,mug

"This is MY coffee mug but works for cold beverages too. I had a (free) stainless mug from a conference for several years and liked it, but the cap on it shoved into the top of the mug and started coming apart. This one’s cap screws in and will not pop out if dropped like the free mug/cap. This one is well designed and should last For years! I love this Thermos mug!",positive,mug

At first he was reluctant to give up his worn out mug but after using this model for a couple of days, he was surprised. Now he loves it and is so happy I found this for him.

Great product. I have purchased several coffee mugs/traveling cups within the last year and I can say I was currently pleased with this one. Secure and doesnt leak....keeps coffee hot as advertised.,positive,mug
Absolutely love this mug .,positive,mug
"This replaced a non-handled version that I had literally used daily for several years.  It had been dropped many times, and the last drop dented the bottom enough that it would wobble when standing up. It had served me well, so I retired it for this handled one.  It seems to have the same quality and works just as well.  Once you get the hang of disassembling and assembling the lid, its really quite easy to keep clean, and when you put it in the closed position, you can shake it up violently and it will not leak at all.An Aeropress fits on it perfectly as well, so if you use an Aeropress, you can brew your coffee directly into this travel mug and be on your way.",positive,mug
I  am enjoying my thermos coffee mug.  The open/close feature is a plus because I can drink from either side.  Love the handle feature.,positive,mug
"I bought this travel mug for one reason - to keep one of my dogs out of my coffee.I've always preferred a porcelain mug for hot drinks. I like the heft and warmth of that first cup of coffee in the morning. But if I sit the cup down my dog waits for me to leave and makes a mad dash to the cup. She silently laps the warm goodness and is lost in ecstasy until I come back and find coffee drips on her nose and chin.  Coffee is not good for dogs.I needed a solution. This Thermos travel mug is it.I heat 8 oz of water in the microwave until it's steaming, but not boiling. Into the travel mug, lid attached set to 'CLOSE' and make my drip coffee. In ten minutes the coffee is done, empty the mug, and pour in coffee, then sugar, then real cream.It stays hot for 4-5 hours, easy to drink from, and the dog gives me side-eye for taking away her quest for caffeine.Easy to clean at the end of the day. I strip it down, remove the seals, and a hot rinse in soap and water. Nothing complicated.It's drinks almost as well as a porcelain mug, but without the risk of spilling my coffee and the dog getting a caffeine fix.  Well worth the trade-off, well-worth the money.",positive,mug
"Thermos brand is great.This cup has a handle and it fits in the car cup holder.It also fits in the Keurig (with the riser off).This is the second time I chose this, but I chose a different color",positive,mug
"I’ve had this thermos for years and use it daily.  It maintains heat as well as cold.  It’s leak proof and the top is clearly marked with “open” and “closed”.  I just bought another one because I love it and use it so much, I wanted another one when it’s finally time to retire the first one.  We’re not there yet, but I was worried they might stop making them in the future.",positive,mug
I put hot coffee in it at 7 am and it is still hot at lunch and even still warm after 8-9 hrs. Ice lasts forever even in the summer heat! Very happy with this product,positive,mug
I take this thermos to work daily without any leaks.  My coffee stays hot for 4hrs.  I add cream and sugar to my coffee so that will cool it down.  If you just had hot tea it would probably stay hot hot 6 hrs.,positive,mug
Just what I wanted.,positive,mug

"I've owned two.  After 8 years, I lost my 1st and had to replace it with the same.  The design keeps liquids warm for hours. The lid comes apart for easy cleaning.

Ice lasts all day and even overnight,positive,mug
I found one of theses and cleaned it and enjoyed it for two years. Many like it don’t keep hot for an entire morning. Some that do are uncomfortable to drink from. This one does/is.

"I know my cups and mugs.  This is a grade A product.  I drink coffee from 5:30 AM til' 9:30 PM.  I've had this one for about 3 weeks.  It's been thrown in backpacks, lugged around, on the job site, knocked over, and kicked.  Very tough.  A gasket/valve prevents major spills when it topples over.  Rotating open/close valve allows you to switch hands without changing orientation on the lid to drink from both sides.  As an engineer and a shop owner, this is a top notch product.  I'm ordering another to keep in my home garage/shop.",positive,mug
Great cup for the car or camping or just around our farm. Easy to clean and very well designed! Love it!,positive,mug
"I am totally impressed with this mug.  I forgot to grab it one night when I got home from work, it was cold that night, when I got it in the morning my coffee was still hot.  I love it.

"Love this mug, but the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is trying to get the cover off is unbelievable.  Usually my daughter is the only one that can unscrew it off. She says it's like unscrewing prescription bottles. I'm not a weakling, but OMG this is hard.",positive,mug
"I'm not totally sure it's the exact same model, but I've had a Thermax Thermos for at least 12 years now. It keeps my tea warm all day! I used to make tea first thing in the morning (around 6am) and sip on it around lunchtime and after school. The heat retention was great!Drawbacks are the opening and the ease of cleaning. Sometimes I have to put on the lid a couple times to get the lid to align nicely (though it's not the end of the world if it's misaligned - you can sip from any part of the lid and the liquid will just flow to you). And the plastic vacuum seal piece has a number of crevices that can be hard to clean. I typically used a scrub brush or a baby bottle brush to get into all of them.Overall, it's a great product - or at least it was 12 years ago. I will definitely buy another one the next time I need a travel mug!",positive,mug
"I put coffee in this mug and it stays hot for 3 hours. If you pre-heated the cup and filled it up it would stay hot even longer. The outside of the cup is always cool. The lid is great with an easy flip tab to open and close the drink slot. What I'm really impressed in is that when the coffee is real hot, the slot is made in such a way that I never burn my lips like other cups I've had. For me, this cup is a prize winner.",positive,mug
I use it daily after the gym for my green tea. It holds hot well ( I didn't use it for cold yet).I love how durable it is. Good quality,positive,mug

A life changer - sorry to be dramatic but this cup has me sipping fresh hot coffee at 2pm that I made at 9am! Fits perfectly in car holder etc. and is comfortable to hold. I’m down to 1 coffee a day (instead of 3-4 half drunk cold cups or microwaved grossness).,positive,mug

"You most certainly get what you pay for.  I don't like my hot drinks boiling, so it takes me about 5 hours before I can drink it.  Great for those who like to have their taste buds burnt off.Always stays cold to the touch.  Yes, the colours scratch off easily, but I don't care about that at all.  It's exactly what it says it will do.As other have said:  the flavour sticks to the thermos.  So I have one for herbal teas, and one for coffee.",positive,mug

"I've used a Snap Seal tumblers now for around 3 years.  The best thing is that they are truly leak proof.  When the drink port is closed, the pressure relief hole is also closed.  I have tossed these tumblers in my backpack upside-down and am comfortable doing it.  The tumbler's rim is smooth, so I think the lid's o-ring should always seat properly.  The drink port seal seats from the inside, so if pressure builds (from hot liquid heating up the air space after closing) it should seal more tightly.You need a strong index finger to open the drink port it with one hand while holding the tumbler in drinking position, but if you don't have a strong finger, you can open it one-handed if you reposition your hand.What I like least is that the top surface of the lid is flush with the rim, so there's no place for one's nose when one tips the tumbler up for a drink.  Lots of these mugs are designed that way.  That's why the promotional pictures always show the models holding the tumbler in their hand instead up to their mouth for a drink.  To drink, I have to tilt my head way back like a chicken looking at falling rain.  (I don't know why the designers don't just move the top surface down an inch or so to make space for one's nose.)It seems to insulate as well as other items of the same price range, which is fine for my use but well below the inflated numbers all manufacturers claim.  I use the tumbler as a drinking vessel, not a storage vessel.  If I don't start drinking, my half-full container of coffee can remain scalding hot for an hour or so.  But once I start drinking, it cools down fast and gives me only about 45 minutes to finish my coffee.I think performance numbers and anecdotes that consumers post on the web for these products are meaningless without a detailed description of the experimental procedure.  For example, the life time of ice cubes depends a lot on whether the cubes are immersed in water.  The amount of liquid in the tumbler and whether you're actively drinking also strongly affects how long it maintains temperature.  Just beware while comparing numbers.",positive,mug
"I refuse to drink coffee out of a coffee mug that isn't vacuum insulated. I just refuse! So let's get to this mug, and I'll briefly compare it with a $20 Thermos I've been using for the last 18 months.**What's right with this mug**- ELEGANT DESIGN. I happen to know from the industry--and you can tell I'm right because look at all the various different, weird drink bottles and mug tops on the market--that it's basically the Holy Grail of drink container tops to have them seal *well* with one finger. A little snap is easy, but doesn't seal tightly. Look at Contigo's Autoseal technology (different mug). It's absurd. Look how complex that is. Look at Thermos' tech on one of their bottles; I have one of their mugs that has FIVE parts to it I have to wash--and that's just the top! It's lunacy. Absolute insanity. The Contigo Snapseal has ONE moving part (physically made up of three parts total, but they all stay together) and is dishwasher safe with NO disassembly! It is a one-finger function, and it seals tight enough to shake the thing upside down without leakage. Now, I wouldn't put anything in a backpack that doesn't have a conventional screw cap, but this wasn't something somebody worked on for 20 minutes and put in production. A lot of thought went into it- CHEAP. This is among the cheapest vacuum insulated coffee mugs on Amazon- FITS UNDER KEURIG if 16 oz (confirmed)- WIDE BOTTOM. This doesn't taper up from a V-shape like other bottles, so is somewhat more stable**What's wrong with this mug**- BIG problem is it has a very small hole. If you like to guzzle coffee fast this hole won't work for you. My wife hated it because of this. I personally like to sip it slowly and for me it works perfectly fine- SMALL (possibly not real) problem is it seems to lose heat through the top faster than I'd like. All mugs like this have plastic, un-insulated tops, but I'm under the totally unscientific impression it feels hotter than my Thermos did--------------I bought the Gunmetal color and there doesn't appear to be any paint that will flake off. Some people have complained about burning upper lips. I haven't noticed this at all. As I said I am a coffee sipper, though. I don't guzzle it, and it comes out of the hole very well. I would buy another one of these for sure.If I have any major issues with this I'll come back and review it, as I always do for things.",positive,mug
"Best coffee mug ever! Keeps coffee hot for ever I love it! Don't know why people are have trouble with the lid leaking, it works perfect for me. If you follow the instructions on putting the lid on it should work fine. So if you're having trouble with the lid you're an idiot!Update-  I have had this Tumblr since July 2016. Still using it every day. I love it. I am the type of person that loves my coffee very very hot. This Tumblr never fails me. I also bought one to put cold drinks in. I put water in it with ice in the afternoon one day. Drink half the water. Left the tumbler in my car overnight. Next morning there was still ice in it. But I don't understand why people are having trouble with putting the lid on. If you would read the instructions that comes with the tumbler it explains how to put it on. It's very simple. So stop complaining and read the instructions.UPDATE AGAIN: well it's been 2 years now and I'm still using the same tumbler. I have dropped it several times including on the concrete. It hardly even dents. The rubber around the outside is still intact and almost perfect condition. The lid still seals without leaking. It is so easy to clean. Still keeps my coffee very hot. Contigo rocks!2 1/2 YEARS! This travel mug is never going to wear out! When I clean this I use a brush for the inside and just a damp cloth to clean the outside. I have never submerged this mug in water totally. I soak the lid and soapy water once a week, other than that I just rinse it really well with hot water. Just so you know, the stopper that keeps the coffee from coming out does come off and I also clean that once a week too. At the beginning of March 2018 I bought my boyfriend and one for his coffee. The 20 oz. He goes through coffee mugs like every other month. He has had this one since last March and it's still in good condition. He's very rough on things too. I sent a picture of what mine looks like after 2 and 1/2 years. Still good . Be interesting to see how long this lasts.",positive,mug
"I absolutely love these things! Only thing to note is that if the gasket in the lid comes out for any reason (to clean it, you drop the lid and it falls out, whatever it is) it is difficult to get back in, and is only effective if you put it back in correctly. On one side it is flat, and the other side it has a channel (the gasket has a ""U"" cross-section). I cannot recall if the channel goes face down or face up (I think it goes face down), but if you put it back in the incorrect way, you are going to spill all over yourself the next time you take a drink because it is no longer leak proof 😂. I have 3 of these and this has only happened once, and I flipped the gasket and fixed the problem, sobi am not deducting a star, but I think people should know. Other than that, all I have to say is that these things are awesome. They're stylish, fit in cup holders well, have a nice trip, opens and closes nicely with a firm and pleasant 'click,' and they pour well. No feeling like you're having to SUCK your coffee out of the mug, it pours out smoothly. Highly recommended, especially if you find one on sale.",positive,mug

"I LOVE THIS CUP!  Boy, does it keep coffee hot, which is what I wanted.  Plus, it fits under my Keurig coffee maker, as long as I take the base off.  I have ordered several different cups/mugs like these and was disappointed.  They were either too tall for the coffee maker or they didn't keep my coffee hot.  I now have a cupboard of useless cups.  This one is different in every way.  First of all, it's beautiful, plus it's easy and comfortable to hold.  It really keeps my coffee hot for about 6 hours or so.  It stays piping hot for a great 1-3 hours. It also has the feature that when you're not drinking your beverage, you can completely close the lid, which helps everything stay hot.  Plus it's easy and convenient to drink from, although I have had a few dribbles every now and then, nothing major though.  This is everything I wanted for a mug.  I'm pretty much housebound so I don't use this for traveling, but I'm sure it fits most cup holders do to it's slim bottom, yet not top heavy.  What's most important is that what do most people want?  They want an attractive mug that fits in their car, or one that you can use at home.  But most important a cup that keeps beverages hot or cold.  I can only address this cup keeping beverages hot, and it does that superbly!  This is a great, beautiful cup and I highly recommend it!!  Look no further!",positive,mug

"Wow!  What a coffee mug.I read the negative comments carefully but decided to take a chance on this mug anyway.  I'm very glad I did.  It absolutely does not leak; one merely has to take the time to back the lid onto the threads before you tighten it down.  You can tell when it's right.As for its insulating abilities, I burned my mouth on my coffee all week until I came on a technique that works.  While the coffee is brewing, I fill the mug all the way with ice and then water, then put the lid on and shake it a few times.  Let it sit until the coffee is brewed, then pour out the ice water.  Pour in the hot coffee, add half and half and sweetener to taste, and seal it back up again.  Even then, be careful with your first sip.  It is very hot.... but at least now you won't burn your tongue.  This will keep the coffee hot for a long time; long enough to drink the entire 16 oz before I notice any cooling... which is why I bought it for in the first place.",positive,mug
"Put this coffee mug to the test today. So far so good. The quality is very good. Its stainless steel inside. Has grip on the outside for easy handling. I like the design of the sip cap. I find it easy to use with one hand especially while driving to work. I really love the color.On the first day of receiving this, I put a drop of dishwashing soap in it and filled it to the top and let it sit over night. I submerged the cap as well in a bowl. I did this to get rid of the new product smell. And it worked.The sip part design of the cap is a little different from what Im used too. But nothing that i cant adapt too.I will wash this mug by hand as I read in the reviews and instructions that doing so will ruin the finish. I wash my travel coffee mugs by hand either way so no biggie.Overall, Im happy with this mug. I will give an update on it in a few months (if I can remember) to see how it hold up. And if it does, I will be buying another one for the wifey. =)",positive,mug
So much better than my old mug from Dunkin that didn't keep my coffee hot for even 15 min after making it.No issues with leaking...matter of fact week just a snug turn I've not seen a drop leave it except what goes where it is supposed to go.Regarding some gross pictures on some reviews I've seen that look like burnt motor oil in the bottom all I'll say is if you just Rinse it out once in a blue moon I bet that will never happen. I ordered 2 more at a price that was so low I don't think it covered shipping. I've found my coffee mugs for the next few years.,positive,mug
"this is honestly one of the best gadgets I have ever bought.  it is also the only container that has never leaked or spilled in my purse, outside of my purse, never ever leaks anywhere.  if you screw the top on correctly and make sure the spout is locked down, which is easy to do, it does not spill.  it doesn't leak.  it is perfect.  I use it for hot liquids, but usually I just fill it with filtered water when I leave for the day.I've used other containers for water and the top has always leaked.  I'm talking to you klean kanteen.  a few weeks before I bought this, I bought a farberware 'insulated' container, but it was a disaster, so that is in the garbage.seriously, the contigo literally never leaks.  its amazing.  I'm drinking hot tea from it now as I type on my computer.  if you're on the fence, just buy it and try it out.  its great.  and no one is paying me to say this.  just trying to share the joy.",positive,mug
"We've used Contigo mugs for years, so we already knew that the product is great at maintaining beverage temperatures.The only issue to caution people about is that you need to be careful to get the lid on just right. It only takes a few seconds. Just slowly screw the lid on, close the spout, and test in the sink before assuming the lid is secure. We didn't have this issue with previous models. I'm guessing it's due to the threading being different (more shallow).Anyway, still a great product and highly recommended.",positive,mug
"Fantastic Coffee MugThis coffee mug is simple, but does it's job perfectly. It is easy to clean, even by hand, but the lid is dishwasher safe so I run it through on the weekends. It fits under my coffee dispenser. It keeps my coffee hot for at least 4 hours (it's all gone by then so I wouldn't know if it stayed hot longer). I can close the lid and throw it in my backpack and not a drop leaks out. The SnapSeal lid is not something I've seen before but it's easy to use, and seals it perfectly. It's also easy to drink out of without some lid bopping you in the face like some of the other mugs.The one and only thing I would change, is they placed ""Contigo"" on the lip of the lid, so you can feel the texture of the letters when you drink. I thought this was weird placement but doesn't really affect my opinion of the mug. I would have moved it to the opposite side so you have a smooth texture. And then other people would see the brand name, rather than my lips.",positive,mug
"After owning and enduring tepid coffee with other  travel mugs over the years, I am so glad I found this one! It keeps my coffee hot for hours!  Some tips:  Obvious, maybe, but fill it with very hot water and leave it for a minute to heat up the metal mug before pouring in your hot beverage.  And that top . . . I've figured out a way to pop it open easily.  I pop it open while it's still in my cup holder in the car, and then I snap it shut again after replacing the mug into the cup holder. Way easier that trying to deal with it with one hand, especially while driving.  The cup holder becomes your ""second hand"" when you do it like this.  I've had NO issues with the rubber-like cover (which I like a lot) as some reviewers have had, but then I also don't put things like this in the dishwasher!  Duh.  Anyway, this one is, IMHO, the best of the bunch for keeping my coffee hot, and that is its primary purpose.",positive,mug
"Big fan of the 16 oz Contigo Vacuum insulate travel mug. Owner of not 1, not 2, but 3 different Starbucks vac insulated mugs and I am pleasantly surprised to find the Contigo mug superior to all the rest. Bought it primarily because I needed one that fits my Keurig 2.0 K575 brewer and it does (must remove drip tray). It keep my coffee hot for many hours (4-5 easily). Since it is stainless steel all-around, top aside, there is no funny taste with anything and everything I store in it. Easy to use, appreciate the rubber grip around the top half of the mug. The SnapSeal initially took a little getting use to but after just one week I feel like a ""semi-pro"". Honestly, its much cleaner than traditional travel mug flip tops (such as the over priced Starbucks mugs). At 7.29 it is only a fraction of the price of a Starbucks mug (by the way I truly loathe Starbuck's practice of overpricing everything). I see the price has increased to around 8.00, still a steal. Great product, great value.",positive,mug
"I have had another of these for years. When the rubber ring came out and was lost, I contacted Contigo and they quickly sent a replacement. When another coffee mug started leaking, I purchased another of these and it's air-tight. Good size, keeps coffee hot a very long time and also works quite well for cold drinks. Just wish they were made in the USA, they're not (guess where).",positive,mug
"Simply the best for keeping coffee hot and 100% spill proof! I commute about 350 miles per week by car and the Snap Seal is absolutely perfect. I have bought 2 now as well as 2 Contigo Autoseal. While I like the Autoseal, the ones I have are much thinner metal and don't keep drinks hot/cold nearly as long as the Snapseal. They are also a lot messier to clean and there have been plenty of reviews out there about the need to clean those very carefully and diligently. Not the case with Snapseal. Just clean like anything else.What I like:- 100% spill proof when locked. I throw it in my work bag locked and never worry about it spilling on documents-Keeps drinks hot/cold much longer than most Thermos type canisters.-Price point-Size/ grip perfect for any auto cupholders- my 2 cars, rentals. Never a problem.-Simple to clean without worry about small mechanics like the Autoseal.",positive,mug

"Excellent. This cup keeps my coffee HOT not warm but hot for a long time. I tried to see how long it would keep it hot for just by making coffee and leaving my home. I drove an hour and a half and my coffee was still nice and hot.It has a nice seal on it, so it’s pretty much leak proof I did drop it by accident walking and it didn’t spill anything. I’m satisfied with this, I just threw away my old traveling coffee cups.",positive,mug
"I love this thermos.  I also own a 20 oz that I have been using for a long time, but I always had leftovers so I decided to purchase the 16 oz.  It is a perfect size.  I prepare home made latte in the mornings and I drink it through the day.  It keeps hot all morning and warm through the afternoon.  Putting a neoprene sleeve around it assures hot coffee for most of the day.  I drink hot coffee until lunch and then I add ice to the other half for refreshing iced coffee in the afternoon.  No leaks, easy to open and drink from it.  An excellent thermos for everyday use.",positive,mug
The price on this cup is really good.  I plan on buying several more in different colors.  I like the look of this cup.  The rubber grip feels really nice to hold on to.  It won’t slip out of your hand.  It’s comfortable to drink out of.  My drink stayed warm for hours.  I tested it for leaking.  It held up and  nothing leaked.,positive,mug
"I looked quite a while to find a good insulated coffee mug and was skeptical about metal ones.  For some reason, I just don't like drinking out of metal containers -- they usually leave a weird taste.  My plastic one broke, though, so I ended up buying this one.  It's the perfect size - fits easily into the exterior side pocket of my back pack as well as in the apartment's free (!) latte machine (yes, I know how lucky I am to live here at Parc Meridian in Alexandria).  It seals very well - no drips at all.  And it keeps the coffee hot for a long, long time.  It's a great value - easy to clean and it looks nice, too.  I'm very happy with my purchase.",positive,mug
"All I can say is that this has become my favorite thermo mug. I drink tea evey day, and when I get to work the tea is still extremely hot with this. In fact, I have to open the part where you drink from just to let it cool down. If I keep that closed, it will stay warm all day! I did not experience any issues with the lid not sealing shut. Not sure if this is because the company improved the lid. The quality and build feels solid, and the way that the lid screws on and is snapped shut at the top truly achieves a leak-proof design. For the price, I'll probably buy this again once I get as much service out of this one as possible.",positive,mug
I use these to keep my 4yos water cold. He can open and close it on his own and he can drink out of it without spilling. I also love that it's easy to clean and there aren't any straws to deal with. Love these!,positive,mug
I use it for my protein shakes. It's fantastic. No matter how much or which way you shake it the thing does not leak as long as the lid is on correctly. Shake stays cold enough long enough for me to drink it all. Great little travel cup. Highly recommended,positive,mug
"I'm not kidding! As long as instructions are followed re: how to put the lid on correctly and NOT OVERFILL, this travel mug *will not* leak.  After I add the hot water for tea, I snap the lid closed and turn upside down so the tea bags get saturated. I do this every morning w/zero spills, so don't know how any prev. reviews could legitimately complain abt this mug spilling-? As well, my tea stays hot for several hours after making it. I'm always surprised when I take a sip after lunch & it's still very warm to hot.  The lid is easy to hand wash, nothing to disassemble- yay, but have thrown it in the dw too. I only clean the cup part by hand, again, per instructions. I have nothing bad to say abt this mug, and actually just ordered another.",positive,mug
I have lost an re-purchased these mugs several times and I recommend them to everyone. I make coffee at 6am and when I get to the office at 8 it is still nice and hot...and when I finally get back to drinking it around 10 it is still warm. I am prone to dropping things and this mug does not spill a drop. I cannot say enough wonderful things about these mugs.For people that have issues with the lid being hard to close - line up the Contigo logo on the mug and on the lid and twist. It works beautifully.I know they aren't supposed to be washed in the dishwasher (only lid is top shelf safe) but I put them in the dishwasher about once a week and have never had issues.,positive,mug
"Delivered four days earlier than expected. It's true that it doesn't leak, even with very hot coffee. Build quality is very good and seem like it will last even with rough use.

"Works really well, keep drinks cold for hours. I put some water and ice in before going to sleep and woke up to find it still ice cold, although the ice cubes had melted. Also cleans pretty easily. I've put a few different types of drinks in from water, iced coffee and iced tea, and don't feel like there's any lingering tastes of any of them between uses after a quick wash. The grip also makes it easy to hold onto.The only minor complaint is that sometimes if you fill it up a bit too much, it sprays out a little bit of whatever is in there when you open it. Not sure why it happens, but it is a little annoying, but not enough of a problem to take a star off or anything.",positive,mug
"Disappointed!!!  Inside the top the rubber bulged out and could not slip back in.  The rubber seal stretched to the point it would be impossible to seal.  Coffee leaked on to my suit and that made me really upset.  Again,  DO NOT BUY!",positive,mug
"LOVE the Byron lid. I have arthritis and find it difficult to hold the button down on the Westloop lid every time I take a drink. I just pop this lid open and leave it that way till I'm done. I thought the coffee would cool quicker than my other contigo's but it didn't. I do close the lid so it's ""almost sealed"" but not snap tight sealed. I have turned it upside down to see if it would leak and it did not. Very happy with my purchase and will soon buy another for a spare.",positive,mug
"This held my coffee at a temperature too hot to drink for hours. If I were to complain this would be my complaint: whew that's too hot. The lid was a little challenging to clean, but if it is cleaned soon after each use this isn't an issue. I'm more of a gulper than a sipper, so I'd say this is as easy as any other similar product to drink from. I would buy this again for my personal use.",positive,mug
"We love ours! Great price and it doesn't leak. Only thing is sometimes you have to put the rubber back into the groove on the lid but that's easy to do and doesn't happen often.

So 2 years ago my bf and I decided that we would only spend $15 on Christmas presents because we had already spent so much money on other gifts prior. I got him this and he turned his nose up at it. Fast forward 2 years and he says it's the best gift he's ever gotten. He lost it and was actually depressed so I had to get him a replacement.  Very easy to clean and keeps things hot or cold for at least 6 hours. I sometimes use it to transport my baby's milk on road trips.,positive,mug

It's easy to fill and screw on the cap.  It's sized so that it fits in my car's cupholder.  It has a nice rubberized grip.  Best of all it can keep liquids hot.  My tea stays beautifully hot for 5 -6 hours through a new england winter commute into the office.  It's a great item with no flaws.  Not only would I buy it again, but I really DID buy it again!",positive,mug
"I already had a Contigo 20 ounce, I liked it so much that I wanted one for my coffee as well. 12 to 16 ounces of coffee is plenty for me, it keeps the coffee fresh and hot better than any other I’ve had. It’s also easier to drink from without burning your mouth.",positive,mug
"This mug is awesome. I work as a cashier and we can’t have open bottles by the registers, but this makes it so I can have my drink with me. It really does snap seal and I know that even one of my other coworkers has one too. Great for me since I’m also a little clumsy and sometimes knock it over. I’ve had mine for about three weeks and it’s great. My friend has had hers for about 3 months and it is still doing its job. If you are looking for a new portable mug I would 100% recommend this one.",positive,mug
"I travel quite often for business so I was looking for a travel mug I could lock and put in my backpack without worrying about leaks.  So far this is perfect.  It seals great, keeps my coffee hot and is easy to open and close with one hand.  I was skeptical about the way the lid mechanism worked at first, but it has worked flawlessly!",positive,mug
"I bought this to replace my old Contigo 16 oz mug, and I love this one even more as the new lid is much easier to clean.  I put a full mug of coffee in this cup each morning, lock it, and place it in my lunch bag.  I never have to worry about it spilling even if it falls over in the bag.  The mug keeps the coffee hot, so I can enjoy hot coffee for several hours once I arrive at work.",positive,mug
"I've never been one to have a reusable coffee container other than a regular, open mug, but after needing to be on the go a few times recently it was obvious I needed something else. Tough to handle, steaming hot travel mugs I borrowed and spilling on myself on the way into work a couple times, led me to the Contigo SnapSeal mug on Amazon. Best $10 I've spent. Spill-proof and the outside remains the same temperature no matter what's inside. Kept coffee hot for hours. The grip is a nice touch as well.",positive,mug
"It's now two hours since brewing and although I have not used the closing lever for the sipping hole, my coffee is still hot!  The 16-ounce one fits perfectly under my coffee maker.  A big thank you to everyone who suggested measuring the height!After one month, I bought three more.Someone clued me in that the easiest way to screw on the cap was done on purpose:  you line up ""contigo"" on the lid with ""contigo"" on the mug, and presto, it screws on perfectly!  That's pretty smart on their part!",positive,mug
"BOUGHT FOR 2 CUPS OF HOT COFFEE.  I HAVE IT THREE HOURS AFTER IT IS PUT THE THE CUP, AND IS STILL HOT.  ITS COMPACT, EASY TO CARRY, AND COMPORTABLE TO DRINK FROM. TIGHT SEAL, NO LEAKS.",positive,mug
Ice stays in cold drinks over 5 hrs at 80 deg weather. Hot drinks stay hot over 5 hrs. By 5hrs my drink is gone. Maybe they would stay hotter or colder then 5hrs but for me its gone by then.,positive,mug
"Rubber seal fails , all over my car seat get coffee,  I did buy this product about 6 or 7 months ago and not use it every day, please give me refund or exchange!",positive,mug
This hot beverage container by Contigo was better than expected.  I love this brand and would purchase fromthis seller again.,positive,mug
"This mug was made with safety in mind. I use it for hot beverages; they stay cool for a long time. So much so that I have to add ice to drink my coffee:)  I love the grippy band; makes holding while driving comfortable and safe.  Some people complained that drinks pour too slowly.  True.  But that's by design.  Even with the mug ""open"", a tipped mug would allow only a slow trickle. It's a good feature for those of us who drink and drive :)",positive,mug
I have a Keurig that you can remove the bottom and could never find a travel mug that would fit. I would have to angle it awkwardly or pour from a cup and it was SO annoying. Bumped into this and amazingly it JUST fits. I'm so happy I ended up buying another one of these.,positive,mug
I really only drink one or two cups of coffee in a day and this cup keeps the coffee hot for hours.,positive,mug
Excellent ting in my bag.1. No leaks. I really not worried about leakage anymore. Just fill with a hot drinks and put into bag and forget about a mug until it needed.2. Hot/cold keeper. Diring a 4-5 hours my tea or coffee still hot.3. Easy to drink while driving. Manual valve is convenient but require to accustom to use.,positive,mug
Keeps hot stuff hot & cold stuff cold. Great value and leak proof. Use everyday,positive,mug
"Keeps my coffee warm for hours.  I don't know why I haven't owned one for so long. But these are great, no complaints. I am totally satisfied with my two mugs",positive,mug
"I have used this cup for about 2 weeks now and really like it. So far it has not leaked, keeps my drink cool or warm, and has a good grip. Sleek style and easy to clean.",positive,mug
"Good basic travel mug that keeps my coffee warm (not hot) for at least 4 hours. Given the dissipation of heat, I would guess this is not a true double wall construction using a vacuum to prevent heat transfer, but it is good enough for me.The seal on the cap is also very sensitive; push it down as far as it will go before twisting or you won't get a good seal. Once properly attached, it is very effective.",positive,mug
"Excellent!!! Kept my , coffee very hot, for the time promised.. I completely recommend this cup!!! Perfect!",positive,mug
Love this product. Does exactly as described. Spill proof 100%. Keeps water cold and tea hot. Very reliable. Durable. I love it. Will be the only cup i use. I am more than satisfied with the quality of this product. Great for a gift as well!!! Definitely reccommend.,positive,mug
"Seriously my favorite mug. Keeps my drink hot for a long time even after I've dropped and dented it a few times (oops). One small issue that is easily remedied is how when you first screw on your lid, if you have the lip closed and you open the lid, the excess air will jump out at you and spray you with a bit of your drink. Just screw on the lid with the lip open to avoid this problem. Sometimes I forget, so my coffee is extra vitalizing.Seriously though, I own three of these.",positive,mug
"This is the best travel mug I've ever had. Leak proof, one-handed operation, and it keeps things HOT in the coldest environments. Unlike most fancy lid mechanisms, this one is very easy to keep clean. I've only had my first one a few months, so time will tell on durability, but the functionality is excellent at this price point.",positive,mug
This is my second Contigo.  Absolutely amazing at keeping things cold.  Easy to clean and I Highly Recommend.I am now on my 3rd Contigo.  I have not changed my rating it is still 5 star.  I would add that securing the lid requires you to gently turn the lid counter clockwise until it is level and often makes a little snap and then screw clockwise.  It is worth the extra effort.,positive,mug
It keeps your drink ice cold for hours. Not dishwasher safe though. Highly recommend.,positive,mug
"Well this item is so AWESOME all my hubby could say was his coffee was so hot and it last him to work he was shocked this is so AWESOME yes you need to practice the closing the top but there was a comment another man said line up the cap to the slogan and it works every time and it did believe me the value of this cup is so great ""ENJOY""",positive,mug
My wife and I love our new cups! Have a friend who says she's had hers for 6 years!,positive,mug
"I have a ridiculously long commute, so having my coffee stay warm the whole trip is nice! I thought I would hate that I couldn't just stick it in the dishwasher, but it's very easy to clean, so it's not an issue. I can at least put the lid in the dishwasher, which is great since it has all the nooks and crannies (just rinse thoroughly afterwards to prevent the slightly soapy taste). I have 3 of these!",positive,mug
"This is a great coffee mug. I turned it over and nothing spilled out. My coffee was hot the whole time it took me to drink it vs having to force down the last of a cold cup. It stays hotter if I actually remember to close the top instead of leaving it on my desk open. But even still not much heat escapes through the small hole. I love it. Especially this unpainted silver/grey one which doesn't have the potential for a ""scratched paint"" issue down the line.",positive,mug
"I use mine for coffee and there has been several times where I have forgotten to drink it for hours.  But when I remember the coffee is always as hot as when I put it in there.  The snap seal and drinking hole took a bit to get used to, and is a bear to clean.  But overall this mug is great.",positive,mug
"This is the second one of these we've owned and the predecessor lasted for many years before the rubber around the neck started to work lose. One day it just disappeared for a time and I decided to just surprise my husband with a new one. I imagine it will be another 4-5 years before we ned a replacement. They're very lightweight but extremely well made. Like all Contigo products, they're designed to last and they do what they say they will.",positive,mug
"I was hesitant about this SnapSeal travel mug but it is great and worth the investment.  My husband takes coffee with him for his morning commute and a few time too many some coffee has spilled from the previous/numerous mugs we had purchased.  So far so good with this one, and it super easy to clean, the lid needs a little more attention since some of the sealing mechanism can hold on to dry coffee/milk etc.  I plan to get one for myself soon.",positive,mug
"This simple and economical beverage container performs quite well.  It retains temperature fairly well and does not leak at all.  Furthermore, it is aesthetically pleasing and could pass as a much more expensive container.  The opening mechanism is firm, but not hard to operate and it is easy to drink from.  I would certainly recommend this for hot beverages and typically notice substantial temperature decrease after a few hours at my desk.",positive,mug
"I like all of the simple features on this travel mug.  The snap lid works well and stays sealed.  It keeps coffee hot for at least 3 to 4 hours and is easy to clean.  I like the 16 oz version, just the right size.  I have used many coffee mugs and this is the winner so far.",positive,mug
"I love this, getting more of these as gifts for friends and more for me! This keeps my coffee hot for at least 1.5 hours which is good so I can take my time and drink. I may have burnt my tongue at first but I’m good now. The drink hole is small but it works for me. The most important thing for me was keeping my coffee hot and this gets a thumbs up from me.",positive,mug
"Overall good, but starts leaking when the rubber ring gets too big and doesn't fit",positive,mug
"We love them. I bought one for me and one for my other half and he uses his for coffee daily, I use mine a fee times a week.We don't babysit our coffee, so i have no clue how long it holds heat for extended periods, but it doesn't transfer to the outside of the cup or lid, and our coffee is always hot, even in 26 degree Alaskan November  weather for an hour.",positive,mug
I purchased this on-sale for a gift so I have not actually used it but It arrived on time and looks great :),positive,mug
I use it when I golf.  Just the right size.,positive,mug
"I drink my hot tea and other hot drinks in this thermos. It’s really leak proof, tea stays really hot for many hours and I love the lid. I’ve tried a number of other thermoses for drinking out of the top and this one (and another Contigo one I got at the same time) beats them all.",positive,mug
"I love this thing. The rubber grippy thing on the outside. The fact that the lid doesn't have lots of nooks and crannies inside, where mold can hide. Simple but genius design. No more splashing hot coffee all over me as I'm rushing downstairs to my car in the mornings (my previous mugs had a small spout but didn't seal). And it keeps my coffee work for my whole, lengthy commute. No complaints!",positive,mug
"I actually ordered this, my 5 yr old fell in love with it, so I came back and ordered another for the hubs when he's motorcycle riding! Contigo is hands down the best value and durability when it comes to insulated cups! Why spend an arm and leg on an yeti when this is half the cost?! My ice literally stays frozen 12+ hours. I have not tried it with hot so I cannot comment on that.",positive,mug
I have had multiple different Contigo cups over the years and there is a reason that I keep coming back to them. I believe they build these to a good level of quality. It keeps coffee warm for a long time and keeps ice water cold for a really long time. Much more effective than just a plain plastic cup with a lid.,positive,mug
Kept its promise- keep hot coffee/tea hot or cold drinks cold  for hours. Definitely leak proof! Love this!,positive,mug
"Love, love, love these!!  My fiance works long hours and loves his coffee.  They keep the coffee hot for a good 12 hours.  The locking lid does not allow splashing.  They are super sturdy, the locking mechanism takes a lot of use and abuse.  You can literally throw it in a trunk or floorboard, with no leaks.  They take a lot of abuse, but they will collapse to being run over to a 16 passenger van, lol.",positive,mug
Great travel mug. Keeps beverages hot for a long time. Would recommend.,positive,mug
"I am a person who spends a bit of time browsing and comparing among products that I am buying. After giving some thought, I decided to order this coffee mug. I was a bit disappointed that it is a bit small, but then I thought I wouldn't need that much coffee (more than 16oz) anyway. I have been using it for a while now and I love it! It keeps my coffee warm throughout the day. It also keep my ice tea cold throughout the night too. Recommended!",positive,mug
My everyday tumbler. I placed it in my bag on my way to work and no leak at all.,positive,mug
"It is a great product. It keeps my tea hot for 6 hours. I do advice to be consistent with the type of drink you pour in it. If it is coffee, then coffee forever and so on. The reason is because it catches smell easily and it is difficult to get rid of the smell even after washing to be able to use it for another type of drink.",positive,mug
"I am really satisfied with this purchase, the cup does not leak and keeps my coffee warm for a long time.",positive,mug
I purchased this to keep coffee warm during the day. The performance is excellent and the quality is great. I would order this product again.,positive,mug
Great for hit and cold drinks!!! Really works!,positive,mug
"very nice looking and rxcellent product keep my coffee hot for hours. Great price,too",positive,mug
"Lid is dishwasher safe, body is not. If don't  overfill; easy to open & drink from. (Fill line marked inside). Keeps things cold (or hot ( very well. Love it & would buy again !!!",positive,mug
Love this mug!This is my second one. I've been using the first one since 2016. It keeps the hot drinks up to 4-6 hours.,positive,mug
"I avoid complicated mugs and tumblers like the plague because of how difficult they can be to clean. Milk and coffee get stuck in the layers of the seal and dry into disgusting gunk. No thank you.No such issue this with mug. Sealing mechanism is simple and easy to operate. Grip is solid and the size is standard, though I've rarely found myself in need of a full 20 oz of coffee. At such a good price, I think it's a great buy as far as tumblers go.",positive,mug
"I LOVE this item!  My stainless coffee deal I thought was a good one but had come to its end.  This one is worlds apart from that.  It's very secure.  It's very nice-looking.  It keeps my coffee nice and hot for a long time.  The amount it holds is just perfect for me, very happy with this purchase and will be buying thee for birthdays throughout the year and certainly Bosses Day!",positive,mug
Love it! Doesn't leak ANYTHING this bottle is just perfect,positive,mug
After using the item for 2 months it stopped working. It spills everywhere and is no longer good to use. Please DO NOT buy.,positive,mug
"I had the 20 oz in this same mug and I was glad I found the 16 oz one, because it fits my Keruig machine. This mug is much easier to clean than the Thermos brand. Keeps my coffee hot for several hours or my drink cold when I put ice in it. Look forward to many years of use.",positive,mug
"The thing is, as you open multiple times to drink, the heat will go out, so it may not keep it hot for long time. But if you don't open frequently, it keeps hot for long. Overall, recommended (y)",positive,mug
These are great. The only downside is almost everyone in the office has this and sometimes the same color. So put some sticker on it to differentiate yours.,positive,mug
"Got this mug for the wife for Christmas. I seals well and holds in the heat for several hours. The grip on the side is nicely textured. I really like the gunmetal finish. One minor complaint is that it's a little hard to screw the top on, but that's not a huge deal. If you want a nice looking, functional coffee mug, this is a good choice.",positive,mug
Love this cup!  It keeps my coffee warm for hours and no leaks.,positive,mug
Love this travel mug and the price. Came in perfect condition also. Keeps my beverage nice and warm for a couple hours. I bought the 16 oz size so that it would fit under my keurig and it sure does (without the stand). Very easy to clean and have not experienced a leak yet. Will definitely buy another. Great product...I am not one to write reviews!,positive,mug
"I love this product. It is easy to garb, easy to clean and it keeps temperature the same for a long time. I have recommended many friends to buy this product.",positive,mug
I love Contigo coffee mugs. This one is my favorite! There is no place where water or coffee can sit and get moldy. It’s a clean and perfect design.  And it doesn’t leak at all. I love it.,positive,mug
"Great size tumbler for coffee and tea. Haven't tried it with cold drinks, but it really retains the heat for hot ones (almost too well sometimes!). The top functions well and it's easy to wash too. Just be sure to leave the lid off for a couple minutes or you'll have to wait a couple hours before you can drink your beverage.",positive,mug
Keeps my coffee fairly hot and seals very well and easy to drink small sips from.  Its good to pre warm the cup with hot water before adding coffee or hot drink.  I like the design.,positive,mug
"Amazing cup! Hot coffee stays hot. I poured my coffee at 7 and at noon whenci finally got around to the last half, still burned my tongue. What i also enjoy is that rhe outside dies not get hot, it feels cool to the touch. The snap seal is amazing. I can throw this in my backpack and not worry avout spillage.  I think ill get one for everyone this year for Christmas.",positive,mug
Excellent quality and construction. Works as it should and look good doing it. Lid is perfect for our purposes since we use a small diameter straw to drink from while driving (allows concentration on road and traffic) with no obstruction.,positive,mug
Best travel mugs on the market.  We have a lot of these.  They keep liquids hot for hours.  Easy to clean in the dishwasher.  Very durable.  Do not leak and fit in most standard cup holders.,positive,mug
everything.  seal was great perfect for the hand and kept it hot,positive,mug
"I couldn't get lid to close properly, emailed contigo, without explanation , they sent me a new one. However it was my dumb butt that didnt realize to push down. Contigo said to just keep it.  GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE.",positive,mug
I've purchased several of these. They NEVER leak when they're snapped shut. They keep my coffee so hot that I have to add a piece of ice to it in order to drink it. And the best part is how easy they are to keep clean. The o-ring pops right out & there aren't a bunch of nooks & crannies to grow mold or other nastiness.,positive,mug
Bought this for my son who enjoys morning coffees. I received the same one a few months ago and love it so decided to get him one. The color is nice (I got gun metal) and is just as great as the one I have. These mugs are leak proof and keep the beverages hot.,positive,mug
"Keeps my coffee hot for several hours. Fits in the car cup holder.  Good sized, seals well, and easy to clean.  Agree with others that if you are gulper, this is not the cup for you.  However, I'm glad this is the case with piping hot coffee. Otherwise I would have burned my mouth on multiple occasions.",positive,mug
"This does keep drinks hot and cold for longer periods of time  then others I have had.  I put hot water in it before putting coffee in, and for awhile it was too hot to drink.",positive,mug
"I have the 24oz one and bought this 16oz for my kids (3yrs and 8yrs). Never leaks, water stays cold all day. Very easy to clean and to open. They love to have their own bottle of water.",positive,mug
This is a great find and a great stocking stuffer.  It truely keeps beverages warm or cold longer than anything I have ever tried.  I have dropped it but it did not dent.  The stainless steel is very easy to clean.  I will purchade in larger size as well,positive,mug
This is my second purchase of this version except just in a smaller size. I needed something that will fit under my Keurig so I can stop pouring from a cup into a mug for the drive to work. I don't really know how long this will keep your coffee hot for since I always finish my coffee within the hour.,positive,mug
"Holy cow! (No offense to holy cows) This mug holds beverages and has a hole in the top to suck the beverages out of.  Who thinks up this stuff?  Really, I want to know.  I want to meet them and shake their hand.  Brilliant!",positive,mug
"We are a family of Contigo users and recommend them to everyone.  I use one as a water bottle exclusively and another for coffee and tea.  My ice cubes don't melt until well past 18 hours and several refills, and hot tea or coffee stays hot for hours.  Best travel mugs we've tried, hands down.",positive,mug
"Contigo mugs are the best - they really don't leak and keep your drink hot for hours. I did have a different lid style (the pop-up kind) and it was harder to keep clean. This one is a very simple mechanism and easy to soak/clean. My only complaint is that when the lid is not on the mug, it can be very difficult to open. But that's a minor thing.",positive,mug
"I don't know how long it will last, but so far this is a very solid product that does what it says it does.  It keeps liquids hot but not crazy boiling for a long period of time, is easy to use, easy to clean, looks good, and is pretty cheap.",positive,mug
"Es un excelente producto, mantiene las bebidas súper calientes, así que es una compra perfecta, la volvería hacer!!!",positive,mug
Nice travel cup. Lid seals tight. Have to push upward with thumbs to open the lid. That means no worrying about spilling a drop. It's much better looking in person. My husband is pleased.,positive,mug
"Great Cup, enjoyed so much I bought two.",positive,mug
this product is awesome it does everything that is advertised,positive,mug
I love this mug.  This is my 2nd one.  The first survived a fall and roll down the street after it fell off the bumper of my truck and I've been using it for 2 years since then.  The lid seals very securely and I've never had a failure.  Keeps coffee hot for many hours.,positive,mug
Excellent product.  Keeps my coffee warm for about five hours.,positive,mug
"This is my 4th Contigo and to all the college kids who are buying the WAY MORE EXPENSIVE Hydro Flasks - you’re absolute fools! Name brand marketing doesn’t make you cool, it makes you dumb in a way that college can’t fix. I have my Master’s and I’m sticking with the best liquid holder ever!",positive,mug
"Love the look and feel of my new coffee cup! The grip makes this super easy to carry and travel around with (and so it's not too hot) and I love the quality of this cup. Seems to keep the drink really hot/cold for a while after pouring, and the seal is tight enough so nothing will spill out when it's shut!",positive,mug
"This is now my go-to mug in the mornings for coffee. It keeps coffee hot an amazingly long time, and I couldn't be happier. While tall, it still fits under our Keurig output if you remove the bottom tray. The small opening and sealing mechanism is a bit different, but it works fine",positive,mug
"I guess this is somewhat simple, but there are so many products that don’t have this type of seal that this is revolutionary to me. I will take this thing everywhere. Even if it is just carrying water, this can be used one handed and is completely sealed when you need it to be. Great stuff.",positive,mug
I bought this as a gift for my son and he loves it!  I would purchase again!,positive,mug
Very durable,positive,mug
"I've only had it for 4 days, but in those 4 days...it's performed just like they say it will.  Keeps warm beverages warm longer.  Easy grip and unique cap make it great for me.  Wish they would make one a little shorter and fatter for Keurig machines.  I have to remove the base for it to fit under the drip dispenser or brew it in regular cup and transfer.",positive,mug
"These cups are practically invincible.  I was carrying one in my backpack while riding my motorcycle, and the fool thing fell out onto the road.  So I circled back to see if I can find it, and the cup was totally fine.  My coffee was even still hot and delicious.",positive,mug
"Yesterday I filled one of these mugs with hot tea around 3PM.  It was still hot (not just warm) after 9PM.The drink opening is a bit small, so, that may annoy some people, but I'll take that if it means it keeps my drinks hot all day and doesn't leak.",positive,mug
This is the perfect travel mug and priced well. It seals wonderfully and is very durable. I left it on the roof of my car once and sent it crashing to the ground and cap stayed tight and besides a nice dent on the bottom it is unaffected.The corners near the snapseal release are pretty sharp and really my only complaint. I'll have to smooth those down but that's only worth half a star so I'll round up. Great mug!,positive,mug
"This is my second one of these. Does not retain any smells like lower quality mugs sometimes do. Keeps my coffee warm for a long time, as I am up and about and sometimes take a few hours to get through one cup. No leaking as long as the lid is screwed on correctly.",positive,mug
Just the right size for my morning coffee which stays hot for hours! No more repeated visits to the microwave to warm up a regular cup!,positive,mug
"After switching from Rockstars to coffee, my husband needed a travel mug for work. He's not very gentle on products but this held up well. It even kept the coffee incredibly hot after he forgot it for a few hours. Great product! I'll definitely buy again!",positive,mug
I like IT.,positive,mug
"This is a great cup. It keeps beverages hot or cold for hours, and I love that I can just drop it on my car seat without making a mess.",positive,mug
"Got two of these, and I love that this one deals up, no spills and keeps coffee hot for hours... Even in the car in Wisconsin in winter... I use it at home too because I enjoy sipping coffee for hours vs. a cup that gets cold after 30 minutes and I was constantly tossing it out. Will recommend as a gift too.",positive,mug
Why pay $$$ for a big name travel mug. Hands down his mug is a deal and a steal. Keeps cold beverages COLD for several hours. Easy to hold with rubberized padded body. I'm buying more for the rest of the family.,positive,mug
Practico,positive,mug
Best coffee travel mug ever!. They are also under warranty if anything happens. I will only buy contigo mugs and the prices on Amazon are perfect!!,positive,mug
"This thing keeps drinks really hot or really cold. It's almost a bad thing how hot coffee stays since it takes forever to cool down to a drinkable level. For cold, I poured myself some water and ice and several hours later, the ice looked like it had just been dropped in. Amazing.",positive,mug
I gave these to my husband co-workers who are drivers. They all love them since they are leak proof. Great product.,positive,mug
"Love love love this cup! Liquids stays hot for 7.5 hours- actually did time test. Cold liquids the same, ice stays solid. No leaks so far. Rubber convenient for grip. Another plus is no peeling since it's stainless steel.",positive,mug
It must be a good travel mug because my daughter grabbed it out of the dish rack and I only see it when she leaves it out. Obviously she really likes it. Maybe she should have written this review8^).,positive,mug
Only draw back is the seal sometimes comes out and then it leaks.,positive,mug
Very nice finish and an unexpectedly tight seal on the lid. I prefer warmed the cup prior to filling so the coffee did not loose heat warming the cup. Kept my coffee hot for hours. Best of all... No drips or leak when snapped shut,positive,mug
Best travel mug I have had...I bought 2 more to go with my other that I have had for 2 years.  Lock seal never leaks and keeps coffee hot all morning at work.  It's been dropped a bunch and has some dents but still functions exceptionally,positive,mug
"I love this travel mug! I pour my coffee into it around 7:30am everyday and it’s still warm by 3pm. I absolutely love it and I’m so happy I purchased it, very sturdy, small enough to back in my purse and lightweight and carry. I brought the 16oz mug.",positive,mug
"My husband absolutely loves this coffee travel mug! He adds his sugar and creamer, closes the lid and shakes it to mix it up. No leaks at all!",positive,mug
Keeps my coffee hot.,positive,mug
"Keeps coffee hot all day long, also my 4 year old put it in the fridge for over 25 minutes as I looked for it and when i found it the outside was freezing and I thought ""crap gonna need to make more coffee"" WRONG it was still hot almost burnt my mouth, I would recommend  this to anyone!",positive,mug
"Holds liquid w/ out spilling, keeps it cold/ warm for hours depending on what you're putting in it. Doesn't fit as well as I would like it to in my car cup holder, but maybe it's just my make/ model of car, may fit great in others.",positive,mug
Keeps the coffee for substancial amount of time. The mouth piece a not as easy to clean but that’s with most cups,positive,mug
"I liked the 1st two so well that I bought a third.  Hot and cold drinks on the sides of my backpack with no spillage, and a spare for just in case.",positive,mug
keeps coffee warm,positive,mug
I love the colors and the way this cup looks. I got it to match my manifestation journal so I can be in my zone when I’m journaling and it really goes well with it and sets the tone perfectly for me,positive,mug
"These use to be more expensive so trying them wasn’t a good idea.Man! Should have bought it sooner.Love the design, easy to clean, easy to use and it has the lip cover.Did I mention the lip cover? My favorite feature to keep things hygienic.Will buy more.",positive,mug
"I love this travel mug! No spill, no leak. I have to say the strongest feature is that it stays cold longer than I expected. I have put ice in it at 4pm and at 9:30am the next morning there’s still ice! Hot beverages stat hot for about 3.5 hours. I would definitely recommend this travel cup!",positive,mug
Mantiene mucho tiempo la temperatura de tu café y fácil de lavarlo,positive,mug
"I love this coffee mug. I feel like it's a premium coffee tumbler with all the bells and whistles plus it looks great! I've put it in the dishwasher every weekday for about a month and it's holding up fine. The logo and other note on the bottom of the cup is peeling off but that's not a big deal to me. I use dishwasher pods, which are more harsh. I do depress the button and shake after washing to let excess water clear the little part that other ppl have seen mold trapped in. So far that's been clean looking to me.Only thing to note:Water sounds like it's trapped in the bottom of the mug somehow. I shake and it makes noise but no water flies out anywhere.. There's gotta be some dishwasher water in there but if it's not flying out then I guess it's okay...? I know it's not but so far it's not caused me any issues. Even if it molds, if it doesn't leak then I'm not sure if that matters?Would buy again but waiting to see if I get any mold issues anywhere or if the cap breaks.

Leak proof and keeps hot beverages hot for a good while. Down side is that cleaning the mug you’re going to need a brush as it’s narrow and you won’t be able to get your hand inside,positive,mug
"I've had this mug for a few months now, and use it daily. It gets some rough treatment (dropped, knocked over), and still works great. Highly recommended.Cons (all very minor):1. Lid does not come apart completely for cleaning, so gunk could lurk in there somewhere. That said, I put the lid through the dishwasher and have yet to find any evidence of anything remaining behind after cleaning. No off taste, no bad smell.2. If you turn the whole thing upside down and try to dispense coffee (as into a mug),  coffee will shoot out of the two vent holes as well as the hole for drinking. Solution: don't do that.3. If you overfill the mug and try to screw the cap on, you will have coffee coming out of the lid, the vent holes, the button, etc. Solution: don't do that.4. If you take a drink and then tip the cup over, you can get one drop of coffee that will fall off of the cup. It basically collects on the rubber stopper if you didn't tip the cup upright before releasing the button. Solution: sit the cup upright before releasing the button, or just ""burp"" it one time to let the liquid drop back into the mug. You can then turn it upside down and shake it and nothing will go anywhere. Some other reviewers are griping about the cup dribbling, I don't see it. Just remember to take a sip, turn the cup back upright and THEN release the button. Or, press the button again for a second if you forget. Seriously. This is a non issue.Pros:1. Read the cons. They all minor, two of them are operator error, one is no big deal, and the last is a simple problem with a simple solution. These are the only shortcomings I could find for this mug. Really. It's that good.2. Hot stuff stays hot for hours. No, I don't have temperature readings. All I know is that I brew coffee at 5:45 and it is still nice and hot at 10. Good enough for me, not at all ""lukewarm.""3. Zero mess. If it is dribbling you either got a lemon or you're doing it wrong. I wear a white shirt at work and I have yet to get a coffee stain with this mug. Spills and drips really annoy me, and this cup is 100% messless, unless you're using it wrong.4. The turning lid/lock is awesome. Turn it closed and you can toss your mug in a bag and not have to worry about it leaking. Also, you can now leave your cup in a dirty environment (or take the lid off to refill it, and sit it upside down on the counter) without having to worry about keeping the drinking area clean. Someone was griping about having to unscrew the top to drink- sure, if it is closed. You don't have to close it for the cup to be spillproof.5. Fits most normal sized cupholders.If Iever lose this cup, I'm buying another one just like it. I originally gave it 4 stars, but I upped it to 5 .... the only real ding is that the lid doesn't come apart 100%, but until I see some evidence of buildup in the innards somewhere, I don't think it warrants a 20% knockoff for that alone.",positive,mug
"I have two problems that made me need the best in spill proof. One is I'm  constantly thirsty. To the point that my moith goes bone dry if I don't keep a drink near. Two is I have a nerve condition that i drop things w/o warning. Weve had to pull up carpets from the water damage from all the cups of coffee I've  spilt. Ive had other Contigo cups that were almost perfect. But if they were not closed after sipping it would spill. Others closed as soon as I stopped drinking. But if it landed wrong the sip button would engage & it would  spill. This new cup has a dual layer of protection. It will not release fluid unless the button is held firmly (but not so firm as to be hard to use), & they put a top on that blocks further spilling when it's  twisted in place. So as soon as I can i turn the lid to lock . Even after the cup hits the ground it helps because even if it does  hit the sip button during a fall I can reach down ,& twist the top thus ending any spill before it has  time. Or after drinking it will be locked over to keep it protected. And stop dirt from getting on the lid. I hated taking travel bottles out because they could get so nasty. And be an embarrassment when the security guards checked my bags. Now they wont see sticky coffee & gunk. Just a clean bottle with a lid covering it. No more dropping drinks in stores & having to aplologize over ,& over for the mess. Oh, & the old Contigo lids were hard to clean. But this is just great. The inside workings now pop loose in one piece from being snapped into the cup & you wash it as a whole (the insides are held on by a latch that folds) & snap it back in after washing.",positive,mug

"I’ve been getting Contigo mugs for years and this is the best design yet. I love the rubber grip and also the new lid design. Easy to drink from. Easy to clean. All in all, a great product! I do wish you could get the lid as a separate item tho. I somehow lost to part that snaps off to clean, and had to order a whole new mug!",positive,mug
"I have tried a lot of different drink containers. I needed something that would keep my drinks cold overnight and coffee warm throughout the day.First, I can put ice in this before bed and still have ice when I wake up the next morning. I love it!Second, for warm drinks it does keep them warm. Not hot forever but does stay warm.This is easy to clean!Now let's talk about the no-spill. GENIUS! You have a double security.  I have arthritis and this is easy to use. You can twist the top cover for added security but I never do and still never had a drop spill.  It has a button you push to open it to drink from .its easy to press and use. This is my go-to DAILY. I even got rid of my sunwill containers. I've purchased one for each of our family members and as a gift.I do not have a big or wide hand and this is very comfortable to hold and the grip is A-MAZ-ING!The few times it has fallen, i love the reinforced bottom because its never dented or been damaged and that's saying a lot for our clutzy family.I would say, you cannot go wrong as a gift for teacher, family member, friends, etc. I wish it came in more color options and hope they do add more but there is nothing else that needs to be improved.If you decide to buy one, get 4!!",positive,mug
"I have had a few Contigo Hot/Cold tumblers before this and have enjoyed them all for being leak-proof and handy.  But this one — with the rubberized/plasticized base and the non-slip grip has been fantastic!  The drink hole is smaller than my previous version and took some getting used to, but overall this is a great Contigo tumbler!",positive,mug
"Best cup ever! I can not say that enough. I jave tried every sippy cup, mug, travel cup I have come across.  I have a 8 y/o and a 3 y/o and then there's my husband... This cup can not accidentally spill! It does not leak. It does not pop open when your 3 year old drops or throws it. It does not leak in your 8 year olds book bag, sweat on his desk and get his work wet, or cause him to make weird slurpy noises that disrupt class and get you a note about your kids strange drinking noises for this teacher. This cup also does not have nasty cylicone straws you have to clean with expense and frustrating pipe cleaners that still don't stop the mildew. When your husband leaves this in his work truck for a week with hot chocolate in it (yes he used milk not water of course) and you open it up to a smell that could kill... you simply dump it outside and pop all the parts open and stick it I the dish washer (twice for good measure.)  I have had this cup for a year now and have not had any issues with mildew or spills with this cup and I can honestly say it is the only cup I can say that about. I saw a review with a picture of mildew in the push button part. I have not had this issue I checked well. Maybe they hand washed and left it wet and soapy? I love the lock on the top that slides over to keep the mouth part clean and keep the bottom from being pressed. This is the easiest cleaning and most spill proof cup ever. The cup will also keep things cold or hot all day.",positive,mug

"This is BY FAR the best mug Ive ever tried & therefore have purchased THREE over the last year to ensure a credible review. After 3 cups of the same design, I can 100% CONFIDENTLY say that this cup keeps my ice soda both fizzy AND cold for many many hrs longer than i ever saw before and much longer than I expected!!!THIS LID IS 100% CLEANABLE. I gave the ""ease of cleaning"" 4 stars, only bc I had to figure out on my own how to take it apart bc instructions did mot come with it at the time. That being said.... i noticed some reviewers saying they ""pryed"" the swivel lid off to clean...*tisk tisk*. If you simply hold the side button in, it very simply pops off. I am able to easily remove any & all rubber stoppers. Yes, the hinges are tadly trickier, but nothing a small toothbrush cant reach. In my case, i purchase a very small brush to clean it with bc I consider this cup IRREPLACEABLE. I REFUUUUUUSE to use any other cup which is now why I am on my 3rd, but only bc i lost them on jobs otherwise they would still be working. Nonetheless, i plan to buy a few extras to rotate them in order to maintain the durability and livelihood of my cup and to prolong my drinking times. I waste a TON of soda without these cups bc i am not able to drink flat sodas. This cup is absolutely amazing & impressive.NO NEED TO PRY OFF PARTS FOR CLEANING!",positive,mug
"I travel into the city on the train for work and was constantly having issues with travel coffee mugs and water bottles leaking in my bag or in my car. But those problems have disappeared with this Contigo! I like that it has a twist cap on the top to lock the release button and protect the spout from germs and leaking. The spout is small so it delivers the perfect sips of coffee without spilling out/over. It also keeps my coffee warmer than other mugs did and for longer too. I'm able to get/make coffee before work and it's still hot when I go on my first break. The no-slip grip on the outside is a great feature as you can hold on to your coffee easier even when wearing gloves. But even if you do happen to drop it, it is made of durable plastic on top and stainless steel so it's pretty indestructible. I liked it so much that I got my boyfriend a matching one and he too raves about it being an awesome leakproof mug. Highly recommend this one for people who are on the go and need a reliable travel mug!",positive,mug
"That was a big reason to purchase a new travel mug. I have a Keurig 2.0 coffee maker and wanted something I could fit directly under it and make a full mug of coffee! This fits perfectly with about 3/8"" of room to spare between the top of the mug and the bottom of the Keurig where the coffee comes out. Just remove the drip base. I also bought a Di Oro gold reusable carafe filter cup which allows me to use all the available settings on my Keurug including all of the K-Mug settings. I just fill the Di Oro with coffee, set the Brewer for 14oz and start it. When done, I add creamer to the top of the mug and I'm ready to go. perfect!The mug is just awesome. It fits my car's cup holder no problem. The design is great too as far as cleaning the lid goes. I was using an Oxo mug which was a huge pain to clean but this is extremely easy. About the only thing that is not easy is cleaning under the rotating locking ring, but that will just pop off to rinse under the faucet as well, and probably something you'd only do once s week anyways. The grippy sides are not only functional but very attractive. The rubber base is good for cutting down on rattles in the car.I actually bought 2 of these as I start out my day with coffee and switch to juice in the afternoon. I use 1 for each every day. I have the all black and black and silver models to know which is for coffee and which is for juice. It's just one of those conveniences in life that really is more......convenient.  Also my coffee stays way hotter than my Oxo mug ever did. I would most definitely recommend.",positive,mug
"I just had to train my self t0 drink from it as it's a little different from other travel mugs.I always read the 1 star reviews as well as the 5 star reviews.  The 1 star complainers seem to have problems cleaning the auto-seal button mechanism (the white rod in the pic). I don't know why they have problems but let me share some hints.1: Use the travel mug for drinks (solutions not suspensions)2: Rinse asap after each use (preferably with hot water)3: While rinsing leave the CleanGuard lid on and hold the lid upside-down under the tap, press the auto-seal (white) button several times to rinse the internal mechnism, turn right side up and repeat to drain out the water.4: Leave lid open (see pic) to air dry.To use. Press & hold the auto-seal (white) button before lifting to your mouth, realize that you're going to be pouring into your mouth not sipping (at least that's how it seems to me). Release the button after tipping back upright (allows liqu9id to drain back into cup)",positive,mug
"My favorite travel mug for both hot and cold beverages.  I like my coffee HOT and my water ICE COLD and this delivers both.  I'm not one to let my coffee sit for too long before drinking it so I'm not sure how long product stays piping hot. Could do a test with thermometer if anyone wants to know. I drink a lot of water and fill this up all day long.  I like that it has a sliding cover over the water hole so my kitty can't ""share"" and it fits in my sofa's drink holder.  I was getting ready to take this on a day trip and left it on the counter.  I put the chipped ice in, put the cover on and was going to fill it with water before I left. When I got home, the next morning, the ice was not melted. Pretty impressive.  To me, this isn't something I necessarily seek out because I drink my coffee hot, fast and refilled as many times as possible throughout the day.  I drink my water ice cold, fast and refill many times.  Plus, look how stinkin' cute it is!  The button is easy to push, the silicone wrap feels good in the hand, the cup is easy to grasp.  The thing I love the most is that I can carry this in my purse full of liquid and absolutely no leakage. Seriously. I do the upside down test each time but it has never leaked.  Used multiple times daily since I purchased it in January.",positive,mug
"I just purchased for $13 which is a pretty good deal for something that seems can take some drops with out issue. I got blue and stainless but cannot see how a change in colour would effect how it works. Obviously it is not microwaveable because it is metal but I didn’t get it for that purpose or even traveling. I prefer to travel with cold beverages and have a huge (not this brand) container that keeps ice for almost three days. All I wanted was a way to enjoy a damn of coffee without it going cold in the mug after a few minutes. I use a Keurig so I do about 10 ounces at a time. For that purpose it stays steaming hot for a bit then has stayed nice and warm for about two hours now. Maybe if filled to the brim, one might get a longer amount of time to keep it warm. But, I do not want a mega amount of coffee so this works great for my situation. Warm is a subjective thing but if think will stay super hot over a long period of time, it will not. The way it dispenses liquid is new to me so I just need to get used to it. It is a very nice quality container, which keeps what I want warm for a reasonable amount of time. It seems easy to clean up as well but then I use a bottle brush. I already knocked it over without the guard in place and there was zero leakage.",positive,mug
"my favourite mug. I have several Contigo models and this is the best. I like the rotating lock, and the horizontal drink button.I ignored the no-dishwasher bit, and ended up with a wee bit o' water inside the shell, but it hasn't affected the use. I still put it in the dishwasher.I like that I can knock it over, and at most just a few drops leak. I think I found the trick, tho- keep pressing the drink button until you put the mug back down. if you release too soon a bit of tasty beverage remains on the lid.I like this better than the other model of auto-seal (arhh,arhh,arhh!) - the one with the vertical button.I can't use the snap seal version- it seals great, BUT you have to remember to seal it. or else you could flail a bit too much and knock it over on your desk and spill all over your keyboard...",positive,mug

"I’ve tried many different coffee mugs. Usually, I don’t like the way the spout is, I end up dribbling. This one, I don’t dribble! If you are a little bit special like I am, this is the mug for you. Plus, it’s pretty, so you really can’t go wrong with that. I’ve read some people complaining that it doesn’t wash easily – you can flip open the spout and run a little brush (or the tip of a dish towel) through it and it cleans up great. Usually I don’t need to run anything through it though, water and soap do the job perfectly.I’m a super slow coffee drinker. I usually make my coffee at 6:30 am when my child wakes at an ungodly hour.  I let it sit open for about 15 minutes because otherwise it’s like lava and I’m a wuss when it comes to hot drinks. Then, I close it up and slowly sip it until about 1:30 or 2pm when it runs out and I need to refill. Never, ever has my coffee gotten cold. This is a huge win for a mom who gets busy and ends up re-heating her coffee 5,682 times a day. This mug has removed the need for this.The second great thing about this mug is that it doesn’t spill or leak. Even when thrown by an angry toddler onto a stone floor. It’s seriously tough. I’ve dropped into my diaper bag, let it roll around on the car floor, and no leakage or problems. It’s awesome.",positive,mug
"Very good , very easy to use on traveling to any place, keep the warm or cold the liquids",positive,mug
I believe Contigo stopped producing this model but I love this style so I bought a few to keep on hand. It will be a sad day when the last one stops working. There are two reasons that this is perfect travel mug for me: 1. The twist lock feature means it won't ever open in my laptop bag. I've had issues with the Contigo design with the clicky lock switch. 2. The positioning of the spout makes it far less likely that scalding hot coffee dribbles down my chin and onto my clothes. The other push button Contigos have the spout at the very top and the opening seems a little wider.. either way they suck. This desisn is just so much better all around.,positive,mug
"This contigo travel mug has a truly leakproof locking mechanism.  There is a half lid that snaps on top and rotates to cover the drinking portion of the lid.  When it is covering the hole where the liquid comes out, you cannot depress the button in order to release the liquid.  This two step method is failsafe and I have never had this design leak, even when I toss the mug when full into my bag.  It is simple to rotate the half lid and push the button all one handed.  The mug keeps my coffee hot for at least a few hours and it fits under my Keurig (which my hydro flask coffee mug does not). I like the grip on this mug and that it is dishwasher safe.  I have another Contigo mug of this same design that has lasted for years.  The lid is easy to clean, I don’t put that in the dishwasher because I wouldn’t want it to be damaged.  Highly recommend this travel mug!",positive,mug
"This is THE BEST travel mug I've ever owned -- and I've tried at least half a dozen others! I bought one for myself about 8 months ago, and it is exactly what I wanted. Coffee I put in it at 7 a.m. is still hot when I finish drinking it at about 10 a.m. It never leaks. After swiveling the lid cover into place, I can confidently throw it in my bag and know no coffee will get on my other items and no dust or lint will contaminate my mouthpiece. My cup has been knocked off counters and dropped on asphalt and it is still in perfect shape without any spillage. Also, it's easy to clean. I remove the swivel cover and open the lid's locking mechanism and give everything a quick rinse in hot water each day. Once or twice a week, I soak it all in hot dishwater for a few minutes and then scrub it all down, including the threading where the lid screws into place. I've never had a problem with it retaining soapy flavors or odors, and when I've used it for hot tea, it doesn't infuse it with a coffee taste (a problem I've had with plastic bodied cups). My fiance has borrowed it several times and also loves it, so I just ordered one for him, as well.",positive,mug
"FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  A coffee cup that doesn't leak, doesn't spill, is dishwasher safe, and the top comes apart to assure cleanliness!!!  I have ordered 5 different ones now.  I never review a product, but I just had to.  That's how great this product is.  I have little kids and always have my hands full when walking to the car, and now I don't have to worry about coffee spilling out of the top of the cup, or accidentally hitting the button and having coffee come out.  If you twist the top of the lid, the auto lock button locks completely and the side button can't be pushed in, therefore coffee can't come out.  I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product.  When you first get it, soak in a LITTLE dish soap and hot water for about 15 minutes, wash, rinse, and you're ready to go.  I've never had a problem with tasting plastic or anything and I am VERY picky about tastes!!!!!!  YOU WILL NOT REGRET THIS PURCHASE!!!!  I JUST BOUGHT MY 6TH ONE LOL!!!!!  OH PIECE OF ADVICE, ONLY FILL YOUR COFFEE TO THE POINT WHERE THE CAP WOULD SCREW ON, IF YOU FILL COFFEE TOO HIGH WHEN YOU PUT THE CAP ON, YOU WILL HAVE COFFEE SPILL OUT THE SIDES OF THE CUP.

"I believe it to be one of the best I've had up until this day. I find it easy to grip, has a great mechanism that allows for a comforable drinking experience while being safe. I haven't pushed the keep warm time that long (5 hours) but I feel it doesn't hold for that long before getting just warm and not hot. The only thing I don't understand is the twisting mechanism at the top which I find that might not be the as useful as previously thought since twisting and untwisting doesn't make sense to me while you're drinking. And maybe it's there if you drink and then put it away with some liquid still inside, but I am one that drinks until finished. That being said, really great product and strongly recommended.",positive,mug
"I like the size as it fits my single cup coffee maker just exactly right for maximum dosage.  It's easy it is to hold and use.  This sounds a bit weird, but it fits my lips great.  Some are too rounded and blunt and others also have a few minor issues in sipping smoothly, but this is perfect.  The longer button that goes more around the cup in the back to allow the top to open for coffee flow is better then the last one I had with a smaller and more square button.  The coffee flow is good for me too.  I'm not like my wife who has to guzzle her coffee and wants nothing to inhibit flow.  I prefer something that buffers the coffee from gushing out to allow comfortable sipping action but with plenty of coffee and not a trickle.  What I also like is the Autoseal since I carry a lot of stuff into my office and I can get tuck it under my arm or in a coat pocket and not worry at all about spilling.  Keeping the coffee or tea hot for hours is great and goes without saying... but I will.  Love it...",positive,mug

"Great mechanical mug.  The seal works great and has prevented me from spilling in the car many times. I have even thrown it full of coffee into the tail case on my motorcycle where it was bouced around on it's side, and it didn't leak.  You do need to lock the button to prevent leaking. If you don't, then either the button may get bumped, or the little bit of liquid left in the drinking hole when you close the button can come out.The grip texture is great and has not shown any wear after near daily use for 6 months.The insulation isn't as good as some other mugs, but it is not deficient.  I wouldn't trade higher insulation for thicker walls of the mug, resulting in either lower capacity or larger overall size.  It keeps coffee hot for a long time and works great. It's comfortable to use and drink out of, and the mechanism works great.It's pretty easy to clean. I get super annoyed when things aren't easy to clean, and while this isn't the easiest, it is not that difficult.  It's really nice to be able to unlock the mechanism for access to clean it.",positive,mug
Love this mug. Very high quality. Does a great job of keeping my coffee hot.When filled to the top I've had it keep my coffee hot for 8 hours. Now I keep it half full and drink it about 5 hours after filling it and it only cools down a little. Have had no leaks since purchasing these about 7 months ago.It's very easy to clean and I love the ability to lock it and cover the hole. The cleaning process is simple. The top unscrews from the body. The body can be cleaned with a sponge. You're not supposed to put it in the dish washer since it removes the paint a little. I still do it and it's barely removed much paint at all. The top cover pops off easily. The top then easily swings open and can be put in the dish washer.I bought 3 of these on prime day and love them. I just happened to find one on sale in TJ Maxx for 10 bucks and bought that one too. They have lasted 7 months and I've dropped them several times. The top cover has cracked for one of them when I dropped it but I can still use the lock with my finger nail. Would definitely buy them again.,positive,mug

"I liked mine so much I bought a second one for my wife.  The redesign on ht elid is superior to the old Contigo mugs (*which had a disgusting tendency to get buildup inside the mouthpieces*) and they are much easier to clean now.  The lids can be unlocked and opened up to soak in the sink or tossed in the dishwasher safely.  These mugs also really hold the heat of the beverage well. I left my coffee cup on my desk after filling it, and then ran to run errands one morning, forgetting my coffee.  I returned at lunch (4 hours later) and my coffee was still piping hot.  Impressive.  It doesn't do as well of a job keeping it warm if you leave an inch in the cup, vs half a cup - but it's 100x better than any travel mug I've used.  It's a slim profile, easy to grip with the hatched rubber coating, and you can lock the lid so it won't spill if you decide to put it in the cup holder for an extended period of time.  I love this cup.  Tiny hands POTUS would be able to easily grip this mug for sure!",positive,mug
"Not only is this cup ridiculously cute, but it has several practical features. The colored part of the cup is grippy to help you hold on to your lifeline, I mean coffee, when you are half asleep even if there are some drips running down the side. It also keeps the cup from getting too worn looking. I use this cup everyday and it looks as good as new. I give credit to the grippies.The lid has a twist feature that not only locks to cup so that you can throw it in your purse, but it also covers the mouth part so that you don't have to worry about picking stray dog hairs or lint off the mouth part before taking a sip of your heavenly liquid.Finally, the cup is stainless steal on the inside to keep your coffee nice and warm even if you forget about it or are just a slow drinker.The only downside to this cup that I can see, is that the grippies prevent you from being able to put a monogram on it. This is a sacrifice I am willing to make for such an adorable cup! buy it, you won't regret it!",positive,mug
"I love pretty much everything about this travel mug.- I have the white and jade color, and it is so pretty!- The rubber grip is comfortable to hold, and the bottom is non-slip. It feels solid and not like it will tip over easily.- It's easy to clean, unlike other travel mugs that I've owned.- It keeps my coffee hot for hours. My coffee doesn't usually last that long, but I have kids, so sometimes I have to step away, and it's nice to come back to a still-steamy cup. I use it at home rather than a ceramic mug for that reason.- The autoseal is great! The button is in an ergonomic location, so it's not cumbersome to take a sip. It's much more convenient than having to manually cover the hole after each sip or risk a spill by leaving it open. And the seal definitely works (I've held the mug upside down and shook it).- It fits under the Keurig, but just barely when the trap is removed.I only wish they made smaller travel mugs like this. I don't typically make 16 oz. of coffee at a time and would prefer something a little more compact. But this is definitely my favorite travel mug that I've tried by far!",positive,mug

"I really like this tumbler so far (I've only had it for less than a month)- I use it basically for teas. Nothing with milk (if so almond milk). Because the mechanism inside would be a tad bit difficult to clean so I don't want to put in it things that can clog up and break down. But if you use it this way it's perfect. I love that the mouth piece gets protected, no leaks at all, and quite safe. It also keeps it hot /warm enough for my needs.",positive,mug

"I LOVE this! I finally found a travel mug that 1) keeps my coffee hot  2) I can toss in my workbag and not worry about it spilling  3) is 16 oz  4) has a sturdy grip  5) Is stainless steel throughout (Anyone else use cheap plastic travel tumblers that make your coffee taste like plastic overtime? yuck.) For years I have been using cheap plastic travel mugs that don't have secure lids--this has caused multiple spills in my bags and leaking in my car, not to mention quick temperature decline. I finally heard of Contigo, and decided to spend the extra couple of dollars to get something that is great quality. I am so glad I did, and will continue to buy this brand in the future. I thought the press-to-drink button would be annoying, but it is not at all! It is very convenient and is never a problem. It gives the mug that extra security. The mug easily comes apart to clean. (Note: As I said, it does keep my coffee hot; however, it does not keep it hot for as long as the product description claims--5 hours--but I get a solid 2 hours, and that is usually all I need to finish my morning coffee anyway.)",positive,mug
"I absolutely love this travel mug. It is well designed, easy to drink from and very sleek and stylish. I am a UPS package driver so I need a mug that is sturdy and doesn’t leak. I have already been through two of these the first one I lost and the second one was damaged but I never hesitate to choose this model when buying a replacement. Keep in mind that this model holds 16 ounces while the Snapseal holds 20oz. If you are looking for a travel mug that holds more than 16 ounces I would get the Snap Seal model but if you are OK with 16 ounces which is the equivalent to a grande cup of coffee at Starbucks then the this model will be good enough for you.",positive,mug
"I drop my water bottles many times in a day on all kinds of surfaces so my boyfriend bought me this and it is amazing! No water comes out, when I have used coffee it stays warm most of the day, and cleaning it is easy once you follow the directions provided. The lid does come apart to clean the stopper so it's important to do that often but it's easy to get the hang of and simple to do. Worth it 100% if you use bottles often (and especially if you are rough on them)!",positive,mug
"Reordered after using very much the exact same model for about 3 years. And no, there was nothing structurally wrong with the old mug it's just... it got too old. After a while, it becomes increasingly difficult to remove the coffee film from the cover because of its many parts. Yes, it's cleanable with a toothbrush and a lot of patience but still, a 3 year old mug is... 3 years old.As for features, what appeals to me is:- perfect size for both keeping it on my desk while working and perfectly fitting into my car's cup holder- some insulation keeps the coffee hot/warm for a while and prevents the body from getting too hot while holding some hot beverage inside- and it stay perfectly sealed when not in use, by far the most important feature to me- also easy to clean but, like I said, the top IS plastic and plastic ages and can never be cleaned perfectly- nice grip too",positive,mug
"Easy to travel and commute with, looks nice and not too bold",positive,mug
"I have never had a Contigo product before but now... I will use nothing else!  I put ice and Diet Coke in it and literally 8 hours later, I still had ice!  Amazing!  Have not used it for a hot beverage, but I know will be equally as pleased!  I love the autoseal!  I will not buy anything else but Contigo autoseal from now on.  I need to trash my other travel cups!Edited 3/11...make sure you do not wash this through a dish washer!  Hand wash only!  The lid is top rack dishwasher safe, just not the cup as it is painted.  It was clearly in the instructions, that I did NOT read!  The paint is coming off right where it meets the plastic at the top of the cup.  It is NO fault of Contigo!  But, I just figured it was top rack dishwasher safe.  So, just don't make the same mistake I did :).  Still without a doubt more than 5 stars, if I could give it!",positive,mug
"Best Contigo travel mug I have owned. The slide around cover is actually not just a dirt cover but also the lock to prevent the button from being pressed in a bag or on accident. Some people like their drinks to stay super HOT for hours on end, this is not for you if that is the case. My morning tea is boiling prepared around 7 and by 10 it is still warm, but not hot. Which gives me a good window of drinking my first fill.The lid is dishwasher safe, which is excellent, and although they do not recommend you put the body in the dishwasher (for the sake of the paint and the grips) if you absolutely need to, go right ahead.  The lid's easy clean lift is brilliant. And all I have to say is FINALLY. I had an old travel mug and the spout stopper was always a pain to clean. No complaints here at all.Contigo mugs do take a little getting used to on how to drink out of them, they don't flow like an open cup, but once you get the hang of it, no worries.",positive,mug
"I bought this thermos two and a half years ago for a camping trip.  It worked so well that I started using it at home whenever I wanted to keep my tea hot for an extended period of time.  I also bought a couple more for family members as gifts.  Mine doesn't stay as hot for as long as it used to (maybe 5-6 hours instead of 7), but I'm still getting a lot of use out of it and would purchase a Contigo again were I to lose mine.",positive,mug
"I like coffee cups a lot so I have a bunch of different ones. Contiguos are great for keeping hot a long time. I’ve had this one for 10 months now and is one of my favorites. Good size without being crazy big or heavy. Easy to carry and I like how the lid twists shut to lock. I walk 2 miles to work so I throw coffee in my bag and this never spills when locked. Some reviewers mentioned that there are spots inside the lid that will grow mold, this is true but I don’t think that’s anything the company can change in order to have a seal that tight you need springs and all inside. I just suggest about once a month or so you take the lid apart and soak it in hot water with a tiny bit of bleach. I haven’t had any problems with the black color scratching off on the outside, which is nice because most do have that problem.",positive,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 This mug is awesome! I had been using a quilted stainless travel mug from Sbux and had trouble every day trying to get the lid to screw on without leaks. I had to test it every day by turning over and if it wasn't just right coffee would spill everywhere. There was no way to lock the twist cap and after it twisting open and pouring coffee all over the seat of my car I was over it! Immediately came to amazon and chose this Contigo mug. Love the colors. Love the silicone grip and fun geometric pattern. Love the push button seal and the twisting protective cap. Some have complained that there is a drip of coffee left on the top after taking a sip, it's not hard to push the button quickly to let it drip back in. Really love how easy it is to unhook the inner mechanism to clean! Really love how the mug fits in my Keurig!",positive,mug
"I purchased two of the Contigo containers several months ago.  My husband uses his every day.  He is a pilot, so this thermos travels with him all over the country.  It works beautifully at all altitudes, it does not leak, very durable, and is easy to use with one hand.  The only complaint I have is that after months of daily use and careful cleaning (I knew I had to be careful with the paint) the paint has begun to flake off reveling the bright stainless steel beneath.  He really wanted it to look nice and he refused to do without the thermos, so I just scrubbed the rest paint off with steel wool.  FYI, ALL painted stainless products will flake paint at some point.  I am very careful to only clean the thermos with warm water, mild soap, and a soft cloth.  It was never put into the dishwasher and still, the paint came off.  It looks great without the black paint and he is still very happy with this purchase.  I would buy it again.",positive,mug
"Bought for boyfriend, a teacher who takes an hour and half train ride to work every morning. He swears by it: coffee stays hot for hours >3hrs, totally leak-proof and doesn't have to worry about spilling coffee on anyone or himself on train, good grip, perfect size, practical design. He loved and raved about it so much, I bought 3 more for his bday recently. I haven't used it myself, but he's used many coffee mugs before this one to know that this does the job.You will have to buy a long/bottle cleaning brush to clean it inside thoroughly. Best to take mouth piece apart and wash after each use so gunk doesn't build up, which I've only seen 1 or 2 small spots which we cleaned with a smaller brush.Bought this 5 months ago, bought three more recently, highly recommend hands down.",positive,mug
"I've been using this solidly for about a month. It gets thrown in my bag on the way to and from work and is spill-proof. Love that the button lock is designed with the twisting top so it's basically impossible to unlock while in my purse. My husband has the U-lock version that locks by sliding the big button upwards, which I find very easy to dislodge in my bag. Not so with this one!I also love that the top comes apart so you can get a good thorough clean. Best design ever! There's no access to the mechanisms in the top of the other one so basically the only way to clean is running soap water through. This one gives you full open access to all the parts for easy cleaning.I haven't had any breaking issues others complain about. The white enamel around the rim has chipped a little but that's just aesthetic and it's not noticeable unless you're looking for it.Keep my drink fresh and warm for hours.",positive,mug
"Buen material, mantiene la bebida fría o caliente por muchas horas",positive,mug
"We have several Contigo mugs and love them all. Three things we like best: 1)They fit in our car cup holders.2) No spills ever 3) They keep our coffee HOT!!!After using Contigo mugs, we would not purchase any other brand. Thanks for making such a quality product at a reasonable price!!",positive,mug
"best best besttttt!!!!!! travel mug ever! it keeps cold-hot for very long time. I am a iced-coffee-drinker, I prepare Iced coffee every morning (6 am) and bring it to school and work. Sometimes I get so busy and have not much time to drink it all in the morning. GUESS WHAT? THE CUBES OF ICE ARE STILL INTACT, the drink is still icy after my lunch time (14:00) There is once I left my mug on the car and I've parked quite far from school, so I didn't go pack to pick it up. After school (18:00 hs. weather temperature 32°C, car temperature maybe 40 - 43°C) I though my iced coffee must be all water-y but not. it still had a little ice cubes in it, the coffee still quite cold.Now, let's talk about hot beverage. DO NOT pour (really hot) HOT MILK-coffee in it and if you can't finish your drink in about an hour or two the milk will go spoil.",positive,mug
"So it's almost 6 months post buying this product and I just started to use my Contigo Travel Cup. Here are the pros I've come accross:1. Nice sleek design, very attractive2.  I have to tell you that I normally wear coffee more than I drink it! Meaning, I enjoy drinking coffee but I seem to slosh it on myself more times than I can count. After using this product, I have remained coffee stain free. You literally have to push a button for the hole in the top of the lip to let coffee out and I think it's magnificent. You can also turn the top so that the little slit is 100% covered. This type of coverage also helps with dirt or anything that might drop into an open coffee mug.3.  I usually poor my coffee within the last five minutes of leaving my house and drive 20 mins to work and find that my coffee is still HOT in this container. Great plus.",positive,mug
"I’m getting into using only Contigo cups for my drinks. This particular one came well packaged. I really like the design and color. I also like the extra padding on the very bottom, to protect your table. The Cap works great, no leaking and it's easy to drink from. My drink stays cold and un watered down for hours. The price was good also. Very happy with this purchase.",positive,mug
This is my favorite coffee mug! I refuse to now buy other types. I was so tired of my coffee spilling in my backpack and then I got this. It NEVER spills. I love it. My coffee it normally lukewarm by 2nd period but my classes are extra long and are like an hour and a half each. It is the only down fall to them.  They are not the worst at holding heat but they are not the best. But the temperature doesn't really bother me. So I love them.,positive,mug
"This travel mug has been amazing! I have had it for almost a year and it still looks great, no dents or scratches like my other reusable bottles! It keeps my tea and coffee hot or cold for about 2 hours and has never leaked. The lid is sometimes hard to clean if you let stuff sit in it too long, but there are parts to remove that make it easier. The stainless steel on the inside takes a good scrubbing now that I have had it for a while, to get rid of lingering odors from strong teas. I love that the outside is a different layer and it keeps it quiet if I am holding my keys or earbuds in the same hand as my mug (no insufferable CLANG CLANG CLANG like my hydroflask).",positive,mug
Contigo never fails,positive,mug
This is my third auto seal cup by Contigo. I absolutely love their cups. They keep my tea nice and warm. If my cup accidentally falls over there is no mess. There is no mess in my lunch bag from spilt tea. I also like that they are easy to clean. I just love the product. Last week I left my cup in an Uber. I immediately replaced it.,positive,mug
"This was my second Contigo mug after years of using my prior Contigo mug. You will love this mug because it is easy to sip drinks while driving, the cap locks and it looks great. The low price never hurts either. Check Amazon Warehouse for a good deal and to give products a second life.",positive,mug
"I've never used it with a cold beverage, so I can't speak on that. I've only used this with (hot) coffee. Ith claim that it autoseals and leak proof is true. I've never had a problem with the contraption. My fresh brewed coffee would stay hot for 4 hours. The rest of the hours, it was warm heading towards lukewarm where it didn't burn your tongue. I do wish that it would be hot for minimum of 6 hours, then again, 16 ounces of coffee, shouldn't take 6 hours to drink, so I won't be too angry about it.",positive,mug
"I have three of these, the first one I bought from Sam's about four years ago. They keep your coffee hot or your drinks cold. The best part is shatter proof! I have dropped mine on pavement and it did put a small dent in it but no issues with leakage or broke the seal.I highly recommend!",positive,mug
"We have three of these mugs, and they're amazing!!! (Although the grey and turquoise is still the prettiest IMO!). I have used mine 6 or so days a week for a year and it never fails me.If I pack iced coffee in the morning, there are almost-whole ice cubes left to dump out after dinner, and the same goes for hot. The autoseal and extra locking function mean this is the only coffee mug I've ever owned that I didn't spill on myself practically daily --- and NEVER in a bag or vehicle or if knocked on a desk.The exterior plastic color has started to wear off after a year or so of running through the dishwasher, but not too bad and it doesn't affect the use of the mug or grip, etc. Probably could be solved by handwashing them as they suggest, but we're lazy.",positive,mug
"I love it. It keeps my coffee warm for longer than normal BUT it keeps my cold beverages cold, ice cold overnight. It’s best for cold drinks. I use mine when we are building our house and my midday my coffee is only warm but on hot days it keeps the ice in my drink till e leave at 7pm. That’s a hard working mug.",positive,mug
"We are a coffee loving contigo family. My husband and I have been using our trusty contigo a for years. We love how hot the coffee stays (it stays hot for hours), the the spill profs feature is amazing.When I saw this new contigo I bought it for my husband's Valentine's Day gift. Ladies, I knocked it out f the park. The black looks very rugged and masculine. The spill proof twisting ""lock"" feature is easy to use. The spout seems to have a slightly rounded shape while seems to keep the coffee from pooling after you take a sip. The only con, as compared with our stainless steel contigos, is that this one requires hand washing. Overall, were big fans.I price compared this with the contigo website, it was $25 on their website but they offered a coupon for an email subscription lowering the price to $20. Shipping was about $5. Instead I paid $25 on Amazon w/free shipping for convince.",positive,mug
"This is a great travel mug that holds 16 ounces of liquid and completely seals it in, illuminating spills. It took a little fiddling around and reading the directions to figure out how it works, but after that it’s been very easy to use. My only quit a it took a little fiddling around and reading the directions to figure out how it works, but after that it’s been very easy to use. My only quibble is  that it’s not dishwasher safe. That means I must soak the top in warm soapy water and manually clean out the metal interior of the mug.  That takes a few minutes, and it’s definitely more work than throwing it in the dishwasher, but for a mug this attractive and dysfunctional, the trade-off is worth it",positive,mug
"Between work and class and working out, I'm constantly going gong going. This cup has proved to be my bestie in just a week. I wanted to stop drinking off plastic, and have my drinks stay hot or cold longer than 30 minutes. Does not spill at all, has a rubber bottom, and looks really nice. I get lots of compliments on it. Probably the most irritating thing about owning a mini cooper is that no cups fit in the stupid cup holder, but this cup fits perfectly! Best part is I can keep my tea warm 7:30am til I'd say about 1pm. Ice lasts a long time too, right now I've got ice in there from 9:30am and it's now 5:24pm, still cold! Great cup so far. Apparently these get stolen quite a bit, so put a sticker or something on it!",positive,mug
"I've been using Contigo cups for a quite a few years now.  Some years have been better than others.  2015, if I remember correctly, I got a new set of their standard 14 oz cups.  They upgraded the lids which made it easier to clean.  But, the cups lost a lot of their heat retention.  I was lucky to have a hot drink 3 hours later.  I really like this new one.  It holds 16 ounces, 2 more than the standard ones I have owned in the past.  There is a cover that protects the drinking hole.  The heat retention seems to be back to where it used to be, keeping my drink hot for at least 6 hours.  The large rubber grip is a nice addition as well.  I like this cup and WILL buy another one.",positive,mug
"The Contigo Mug that I just  bought was for a gift but I also own the same thing and that's how I know what a great product it is.  I bought mine because I have difficulty with mobility and walking with a cane and coffee was problimatical at best. My  friend will use his for travel, walking his dogs, and hiking.",positive,mug
Love the rubber grip the bottom gray portion is also rubber so it won't slide.,positive,mug
"This cup is great for being on the go. I keep mine in my backpack and I needed something that doesn't leak. Just be careful when cleaning it, there's a lot of small moving parts so you might want to use a brush to clean in there. It keeps my coffee hot for a while. I wish I would have gotten a larger cup since I'm out all day, but it looks nice and doesn't make a mess. Fits well in my car cupholder and backpack pouch. I even pour my sugar and cream in my coffee and shake the cup to mix it and it doesn't leak.",positive,mug
"Really amazing mug. I wasn't really believing that my coffee would stay so hot for so long, but I was wrong. I had to take small sips of my coffee for over an hour, because it was still so hot. I took the mug out with me to run errands, and the temperature outside was around 20F, but the mug performed beautifully, keeping my coffee hot the whole time. It's great!My only issue is that even with soaking and light scrubbing of the mouthpiece does not remove previous days' coffee ""taste"" from it. I may have to start using soap, but I worry that the soap smell will also stick to the plastic, and ruin the coffee flavor. This is a work in progress for me, but not a deal breaker in the slightest. I can get most of the coffee smell out, but hints of it are still there the next day.",positive,mug
My husband loves it,positive,mug
"I'm in love with my coffee cup. I had an old Aladdin ecycle that I loved for years. When I lost the lid I looked for something equally durable to replace it.  I'm a mom, so it would need to withstand falling to the ground, be able to go in the dishwasher and keep my coffee hot for hours until I could get to drink it. This cup did not disappoint.  I love the spill proof lid, which is surprisingly easy to wash. The only thing I can't stand about this cup is it is metal so you can't pop it in the microwave.  Luckily it does such a good job keeping things hot this isn't really a huge problem.",positive,mug
I especially like that it is leakproof and retains the heat or cold for hour and hours. It is completely sealed so nothing can get into it! Love it and bought one for a gift!,positive,mug
"I absolutely love these travel mugs stainless steel - no coating color). It is my 3rd time purchasing (because I feel like I need a new one each year... not because they dont last... just cuz I'm weird that way).They are very sturdy, leak proof, keep coffee warm for hours and ok to clean (recommend you rinse lid each use/day).Did purchase the black one before and the color starts to chip off after so many washes... I am a daily user.  Recommend stainless steel to also be able to use in dishwasher.  I have washed lids in dishwasher no problem.",positive,mug
This is my second one. My first I used every day and it got beat up a bit.  Love how this is totally leak proof and I can use it with one hand so it is easy to use while driving.,positive,mug
I really like it,positive,mug
I bought this to replace my older version of this cup when it broke. I was a little hesitant because I loved my old one so much that I was worried this one would not live up to expectations. I have been using this cup for about a month now and it is great! It keeps my coffee hot for a really long time! You have to push a button when drinking so no spills when I’m juggling too much at once. I like that it can be locked to ensure it is not accidentally opened and spills. It is VERY easy to clean. We use a small bottle brush to really clean the top. I think this lid opens more than the older model and is easier to clean. Definitely recommend.,positive,mug
"My husband needed a coffee mug that would be safe around our little 1.5yr old. After some researching, I chose this mug for him. It has a screw top lid instead of just a vacuum seal one, it has a button to actually dispense the drink (so he can't accidentally leave it open), easy to clean by just pressing the button made for easy cleaning and throwing in the dishwasher, good grip, keeps coffee hot for hours, and has survived several drops so far unscathed.We're really happy with it. My husband's only complaint- he has to wait too long to drink the coffee because it's too hot. Good problem to have!",positive,mug
"Wow. I love this cup! It keeps my drink hot for hours! As a busy mom of twins, it has been so nice to enjoy HOT coffee again! Before I found this, I was reheating my coffee about 8 times a day by the time I finally finished one cup. It does not leak at all. My toddler knocked it over and I didn't know until several minutes later. When I picked it up, not a single drop of coffee had spilled! Love it!",positive,mug
"I love these mugs because they never spill. I recently purchased my second after having the first one for several years. The white one with teal grip was my first, and I replaced it because the grip became dull-colored over time and the white paint started to flake around the seams. This time I bought one of the darker colored ones, since I think it won't show wear & tear as obviously over time. My only real complaint is that grime tends to build up in the underside of the lid over time. I just try to stay on top of making sure grime doesn't have a chance to build by rinsing and washing it regularly.",positive,mug
"I use this mug every single day to drink coffee on the way to work, I love it so much. It keeps the coffee hot, it doesn't add any weird flavor, it's super easy to drink out of, and it is extremely spill proof. The only thing that I would change is that it is pretty hard to clean thoroughly, and every single internal piece is starting to smell like coffee to an almost unpleasant degree. I religiously rinse it out as soon as I get to work, disassemble every piece that can be disassembled, clean them individually, and then allow them to thoroughly dry on my desk.  There are just some parts of the mechanism that you can't get to, and those are getting pretty coffee scented.",positive,mug
"                    The media could not be loaded.                 Me encanta el termo, justo lo que necesitaba. Mantiene mi agua fría por mucho tiempo, es bastante cómodo para llevar en cualquier lado, excelente",positive,mug
"I love this thing! It's super cute and keeps my drinks warm for a few hours. I initially bought it when I knew I would be traveling early in the morning, and had the coffee shop at the airport make my drink in the cup. That way it stayed hot for the duration of the flight, and I didn't have to worry about accidentally spilling. Just make sure to open it away from your face to let out any pressure built up. What really sets this apart from other travel mugs is the spout shield. I can't stand the thought of touching the part I drink from directly, or that it might touch other surfaces in transit. The little shield swivels easily in and out of the way to protect the cup from germs.",positive,mug
"Wow, this travel mug keeps hot beverages HOT! All day long. It’s necessary to allow the beverage to cool to a drinking temperature before putting on the lid. The lid is genius, comes apart for easy cleaning and is leak proof. The outside stays cool and is comfortable to hold. Highly recommend this mug!",positive,mug
"I love Contigo products! As someone who has neurological issues where grip can be an issue, dropping these is no big deal. I've beat up all of my different cups from this company, thrown them in bags as I go about my day working, used them for hot and cold drinks, and generally they've become the only cups I use on a daily basis. They're easy to clean, this particular one I love the rubber grip and that the bottom doesn't skid. I wash mine daily and watch for wear and tear but so far I haven't had any issues with that. I highly recommend these for anyone who is on the go, for people who have grip issues, and fit anyone who likes their drinks to stay at a consistent temperature.",positive,mug
"What appeals to me is the rotating lid on the top that covers the mouthpiece. Compared to other mugs, even some Contigo mugs the mouthpiece is usually left open to the elements. When the lid is covering the mouthpiece, it locks the button for pouring/sip preventing spills when it's in a backpack or purse. Keeps liquids warm for a lengthy period. Brewed coffee is kept warm for about 4-5 hours. Fits about 2.5 cups of liquid. Highly recommended.",positive,mug
Awhile ago a client purchased one of these for me as a gift and I loved it but unfortunately lost it.  I purchased this as a replacement.  I have little ones that have the unique talent of knocking over my coffee so I use this both at home and on the road.  It has an option to use an automatic locking function that when you want to drink you simply tilt to drink and press and out comes the super hot coffee.  It keeps liquids hot or cold for hours and opens up nicely to throw in the dishwasher for cleaning.Love love love and highly recommend!,positive,mug
"I love my contigo and have been using this style for a while.  I actually wanted to purchase more and noticed they have a new design of this one coming out.  No, keep the old style please.  The new one uses more metal so hotter hands and metal to mouth.  Pass.  As for cleaning, I really do not have an issue.  Under the mouth piece, the stopper pops loose and cleaning is not hard.  Also wash mine in the dishwasher with no issues.",positive,mug
I love the fact that it’s leaf proof. It keeps my coffee warm for hours and it way to clean,positive,mug
"I broke my ankle a little over a month ago, and I live alone.  I bought this for a very specific purpose, to throw my coffee and tea from my kitchen to the living room.  No extra hands with crutches!  Well, all I can say is it's awesome!  I've thrown it across my house four or more times not and have not spilled a drop.  I was terrified the first time I did it.  It has been wonderful!  So, if you need a container that keeps cold things cold and hot things hot and you need to be able to chuck it across the room, this is the perfect product!  Happy drinking!",positive,mug

"I have a 2-1/2 hour each way multi-mode (bus, ferry, train, light rail, bus, walk) commute and this mug has been my trusted partner.Unlike my previous travel mugs it doesnt leak ever, I can’t accidentally forget to close it before putting it in my backpack, it stays hot longer, and it’s easy to keep clean.The only problem with this travel mug, like my many previous travel mugs, is it is just as easy to lose. ☹️",positive,mug
"Ordered this for a steal ! I’ve been using this for more than 2 weeks now and I absolutely have no complaints except that the cleaning is a bit of a task to do . When you haven’t cleaned the mug for a while, it starts smelling and the residue sticking to the bottom doesn’t come off that easy . Other than that, the flask is great and keep the coffee nice and warm for as long as I expect it to be !",positive,mug
"This is a great mug. I used the West Loop before and was always happy with it but this one offers some improvement that I don't want to miss anymore. The button lock for the autoseal button is simply amazing. If you carry the mug in a bag, etc...you want the button to be locked to avoid spills in case something accidentally presses against it when you're not looking.The mechanism that locks the button also provides protection for the actual sip opening. Also pretty great improvement as it keeps the opening clean from whatever might try to get into there.All the parts are easy to clean and easy to take apart. The lid is dishwasher safe for extra cleaning. All in all, a really great travel mug.",positive,mug

"My fourth-grader uses this as her desk water bottle at school. I'm not a fan of drinking from plastic, and those bottles are so lightweight that they fall easily... water bottles crashing to the floor is already driving the teacher nuts, and it's only September! This stainless steel bottle is bottom-heavy and my daughter reports that it has never fallen off of her desk. The top has a cover that slides over where you drink, so that's some nice germ-protection, since it travels back and forth to school, on the bus, in the side pocket of her backpack, coming into contact with who knows what. It's also never leaked, so I can't ask for more in a water bottle!",positive,mug

So worth it.  It is important to clean the lid very well including really rinsing out the coils because they can get clogged with coffee leftovers, but you won't be disappointed",positive,mug

"I love my new mug. It doesn't leak when it falls over and keeps my tea piping hot. I have no problem pushing the button when I want to drink. Will say to be careful to have the opening away from you the first time you go to take a drink after filling it with really hot beverages. Air pressure builds up and it can pop a bit out. But, after that first time, there's no issue.Wish that the tea infuser worked properly instead of falling to the bottom and having to burn my fingers getting it out, but this cup works perfectly. I just have to brew my tea, then pour it into the mug instead of using the infuser.",positive,mug

"This awesome cup is leak free, easy to clean, AND the top rotates to cover where you sip from making it a good choice for when you may be around people whose germs you’d like to avoid.",positive,mug

Keeps hot beverages really hot for hours. Cold beverages stay frosty cold for an incredibly long time. I left the travel mug in my car overnight; the cold beverage was still refreshing hours later. The lid lifts up inside to make it easier to clean. One complaint: hot beverages tend to create some type of pressurized environment in the container so be really careful when opening or closing the lid. Be sure not to fill to the top because the beverage will overflow when the lid is added. I plan to purchase another as a gift because the rubberized sides and bottom make it easier to carry. My old travel mug constantly slipped out of my hands. This one is nice and secure and won't scratch the surface of my desk.,positive,mug
This does not alter the taste of my coffee like some other mugs have.  It would have been nice to have a carry handle but I found a cute pouch on Amazon to carry it in.,positive,mug
"Every Contigo product we’ve purchased has been amazing. The best thing, they are always improving on the design. The leak-proof lids are the best out there. By adding a rubber bumper to the base you’ll avoid those dents when you inevitably drop it.",positive,mug
"This is the best travel mug!  I use it everywhere... around the house, in the car, travel...  I am kind of clumsy and often knock water bottles over.  Only a drop or two will spill from this one.  You can't spill the contents!  I have not seen anyone like it anywhere.  There are non-spillable ones, but they have fixed plastic straws which I don't like.  This just has a hole that opens when you push the button on the other side.  Also the top turns around so that even the hold is covered up, but it really doesn't leak anyway.  I have now ordered 4 of these -- one for a Christmas gift.",positive,mug
"I would say that this is my travel mug of choice, even though I have so many mugs and thermoses. It's easy to use, clean and it just never leaks.",positive,mug
"This travel mug is the best I've had! It's the second one I buy, the first one still works but since I did not read the cleaning instructions it got stains and mold. I recommend reading the instructions because it is tricky to get to those tiny tight spots where mold may accumulate. I will eventually buy the cleaning tools that are sold separately to clean those parts. Other than that it is a great and convenient mug.",positive,mug
"Easy convenient one hand closing opening, easy cleaning, and bomb proof so far! I liked it so well I bought three of them! Manufacturer May disagree but I find it works great for carbonated liquids and holding the pressure as well as releasing said pressure safely before drinking.",positive,mug
Overall this is a great cup drinks stay cold for DAYS!!!! Very leakproof I have knocked over a couple of times. Keep forgetting to push button to drink but once I do it’s easy to drink from,positive,mug
"We bought this two years ago, besides mild paint chipping on the top, due to our using the dishwasher numerous times....which i do not recommend, as I feel it has made the heat retention slightly less strong. It has truly held up great. It washes well, and if you dont use the dishwasher over and over, it will hold heat for like 8-11 hours! its crazy. Now after all the dishwasher use it is more like 5 hours. But hey, still not bad! We love these and gift them all the time! ALSO for clumsy people...like myself..this is a life saver, i mean, tossed in a diaper bag next to my wallet and never dropped a drip. Its amazing :)",positive,mug
"My wife and I each own one, we love these things. The 16 oz. is the perfect size for us because it fits under our Keurig and fits in the vehicles cup holders. Both highly important! The Contigo keeps our coffee hot for hours and never leaks. I literally flip my cup around while coffee is still in it. The lid is a little difficult to clean but we just put it in the dishwasher once a week to do a better job. Like I said, love these!",positive,mug
"I lost my mug at work. I bought this one to replace it, but then I found the old one. Instead of returning this one, I am saving it because I prefer this design to the newer one and it was hard to fine.",positive,mug
"Coffee still hot hours later! I have really bad hands and the grip around the cup rather than a handle is amazing! Also has a pressure release button, so the steam doesn't burn u.",positive,mug
"The pressure fit seal is key.  I dump some boiling water in with a loose leaf tea bag at 8am.  Around noon the other mug is gone and I pop the top on this Contigo; the tea is still hot to medium, great for an afternoon bump.The plastic cover over the drinky hole broke after several drops but thats not really the product's fault.  Any other mug might have spilled but this one is solid.",positive,mug
"I started a new job that doesn't have a coffee machine in the office and I was tired of buying coffee every day, so I decided to invest in a mug so that I could bring coffee from home. I ride the bus + train to work every morning so being spillproof was a must. I made my coffee this morning at 6:30 am and it's still HOT 2 hours later.  I haven't had to clean it yet, but it shouldn't be difficult (I plan to just put in the dishwasher). Definitely recommend it!",positive,mug
It does not leak and keeps my coffee warm for hours! And it’s pretty.,positive,mug
"This travel mug has been the best one we've used, even compared to some older Contigo autoseal mugs.  I would absolutely buy another one if the need to every arises, and I would definitely recommend this mug for ease of cleaning and overall design and implementation.  Great product!PROS:+ Sturdy and solid quality.+ No leaks and locking is easy.+ Keeps contents warm for hours.+ Extremely easy to clean. (Thank you, Contigo!!!)CONS:- Some of the black paint chips off over time.- Heavy!- Very tight fit in my car's cup holder.- The lid/cover is fairly brittle and can easily shatter or crack if dropped.",positive,mug
"Very happy with my purchase.  Keeps my coffee hot, and no spills ever.  The button is a little hard to press, but that is what makes it so spill proof --so it is worth it.",positive,mug
"I was a little hesitant to buy this as the price was high (for me anyways, I can be cheap!). However, I saved up my Amazon points and splurged on this mug. This thing is a lifesaver!! It keeps my morning coffee, usually made at 6:30, warm until at least 11, haven't let it go longer than that before. I also love that it is leak proof! I throw it into my bag and I haven't had any issues with it leaking or spilling which is a nice change for me to not have coffee all over myself by the time I get to work. :)Oh, and the teal color is just divine!!",positive,mug
"I love this thing!I use it almost every day and I never had a problem with it. All the components are well made the seal is perfect and the safety lock means that I can stick it in my briefcase if I don’t want to carry it around at any point. Liquids stay hot for a few hours.I wonder if the paint will scratch off as time goes by, but I haven’t seen any signs of that happening in the last two months. I’d think that as long as one’s reasonably careful with it, it should last for a long time.",positive,mug
"I am glad I can still find this on Amazon can't find the stores anymore ,it's my favorite",positive,mug
"I like that it keeps my drink hot for hours, no need to keep going to the microwave to reheat. It keeps cold drink cold for hours as well.  Great cup",positive,mug
"Will have to update in a week or two, I’ll be using this for when I have in person college lectures. I love contigo and this seems to be a quality product. I have high hopes for this tumbler",positive,mug
"This thermos is true to its word at keeping my coffee hot for hours. I’ve never had a thermos keep my drink hot for the length of time this does. I’m a slow coffee drinker & this thermos does the best job at keeping my drink hot over extended periods of time. At 4 hours in from initially filling my cup, it still is as hot as when I poured it! I was pleased and surprised at how well it kept its temp! I will never buy a different kind again.",positive,mug
"Great quality. I've had another Contigo travel mug and this one did not disappoint either. I bring it everywhere I go, mainly to work. It keeps my coffee nice and warm throughout the day. I love that autoseal and twist top to ensure it does not spill and I've tested it by putting it sideways in my bag. Seals perfectly and no drips or leaks at all. Just have to make sure you keep it away from your face when you initially press the autoseal button because it will cause a ""spritz"" from the intense heat. It does give a warning in the instructions. Very satisfied with it!",positive,mug
"This is a great travel mug. It just fits in my single-cup coffee brewer. The lid is an ingenious design that keeps the coffee hot and doesn't spill. The lid can also be taken apart to thoroughly clean in the dishwasher. The base on mine is unpainted so it can go in the dishwasher too. No handle to get in the way when trying to fit into various cup holders. The textured grip of the base is all I need to hold on while drinking. My husband was so impressed, I had to order one for him too.",positive,mug
I love this brand's coffee mugs. My boss gave it to us for Christmas. So I wanted to give this mug to my brother.There is a one thing that I really liked was a top of that mug. It's safe and you have a extra cover for the hole after lock.,positive,mug
This is the best cup I ever have that’s my 2nd cup I order. I will purchase again if I need it,positive,mug
Great and comfortble for the morning cofee.Didn't leak when it fell,positive,mug
"I have had my fair share of coffee travel mugs and this one is the best I've ever owned. Never has spilled in any of my bags and has an easy cleanup. The white hasn't chipped off or gotten dirty. Great travel mug for students if you're sticking it in your backpack and walking around campus. The top broke because it got dropped, so I put in a claim on Contigo's site with pictures and they sent me a whole new mug. Great customer service. I would give 10 stars if I could.",positive,mug
Great insulation and leak proof. And I like that you can cover the mouth part when taking it out with me. And everyone enjoys anything dishwasher safe 😁.,positive,mug
Aunque el mio gotea un poco el producto sigue siendo bueno.han mejorado el exterior pero su rendimineto sigue siendo el mismo.eso no lo han mejorado.por lo tanto es mejor comprar uno menos costoso,positive,mug
"Love this mug - after one too many coffee spills on my way to work, I had to get a contigo! This one has the added benefit of TWO forms of protection - the button seal mouthpiece AND the swivel top to prevent any residual from the mouth piece getting on anything. I've never had an issue with this - absolutely love it!",positive,mug
"I've gone through a few travel coffee mugs over the years, and this is the best one I've ever had. It's genuinely leak-proof, and it's easy to clean by hand or by taking the lid apart and running it through the dishwasher. (I wash the mug body by hand.) It also looks great, keeps drinks hot or cold, fits into a water bottle cage on a bike, and has a good non-slip grip. I'd highly recommend it!",positive,mug
These are great thermal mugs.  I had lost my previous one and needed a replacement.  I use it every day.,positive,mug
"I've had this mug for two years now and use it almost daily. It never leaks, it keeps my drinks hot and I've even dropped it a few different times and it's still totally fine.I love that all the pieces come apart so that I can really clean it, and it's really easy to take apart and put back together. Hands down the best travel mug I've ever used, and it's also super cute. Would highly recommend to anyone who is clumsy and needs a mug they can count on.",positive,mug
"This is my commuter cup. I have used it daily since I got it. Excellent design and construction. Good rubber grip pattern on the outside. I finally figured out that rotating the top cover locks the button that you press to open the hole for drinking so I have no qualms about putting it in my bag with my laptop. It may not be quite as good at keeping things hot/cold as my Hydroflask tumbler, but for the money it is a great product!",positive,mug
"These mugs are great! I already have 1 which I bought about 2 years ago and use daily, it still works perfectly fine, no leaks, no breaks, very durable. The only reason I got a new one was because the older one looks worn down and it is stained from the coffee. I would completely recommend this product to anyone.",positive,mug
Love the mug.Easy to use and keeps things mostly hot and cold things very cold.Looks great and always get comments about where i got mine from.,positive,mug
"By far my favorite brand of travel mugs. They knocked it out the park with this one. The only thing I wish, is that it was a 20oz mug. It is hard to tip over with the rubberized bottom base. Keeps coffe hot for hours and warm for hours more. The rubberized grip around the mug looks good and is perfectly functional. The auto seal button is far improved over prior models. The inner housing flips open for improved cleaning access as well. The flat black stainless steel makes it look pretty sweet too. Is it weird that I'm enameled with my mug? Getting it on Prime Day was the ultimate bonus.",positive,mug
"Muy buen producto, es justo lo que se describe y lo dice alguien que toma al menos 8 cafés al día.",positive,mug
This thing is a miracle I've dropped it plenty of time and I work in a ware house definitely will be looking for more colors of these cups,positive,mug
Awesome cup to carry your hot or cold drink. Knock it over and you don’t have to worry about a spill! Best cup I own!,positive,mug
"I purchased this after misplacing an older model Contigo travel mug. Both are good options, but the upgrades on this one are particularly great. This one is slightly wider, so my pour over fits perfectly (the older model was smaller and it didn't quite fit, so making coffee directly into the mug was really precarious). The grip is a nice touch, especially when wearing winter gloves. And I really like the cover that twists over the mouthpiece--it makes it a little more difficult to clean, but it seems more sanitary, since I carry this around in the side pocket of my backpack.",positive,mug
"My husband loves this mug. This is his second one. It keeps his coffee warm for hours! They stopped making this model and I could not find it in any of the stores. He likes it because it has a plastic piece that covers the area you drink out of, which keeps the dirt out. He uses this every day.",positive,mug
"So far, so good. It was packed in a plastic bag in a box full of other orders I placed. It didn't come in it's individualized Contigo box, which is no big deal. I wasn't worried about it getting damanged from rolling around without bubblewrap. The colors are true to photo ad. The lid seems to be in working order. No cracks or stains on it. This is a gift. If I don't update, then assume all is well.",positive,mug
Our favorite travel mugs and for every day usage with pets around.Best to clean everyday to keep stains to a minimum.,positive,mug
