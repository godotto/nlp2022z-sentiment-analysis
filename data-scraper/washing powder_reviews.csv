"I had to move into a home in FL that the city water is yellow, stinks and is full of dirt, minerals. Even the dogs can't drink it. My first load of dark wash came of with horrible, white blotches and rings all over them! I found a product called Calgon Water Softener which is a liquid they sell at Publix and here on Amazon. It works well and the clothes come out normal and clean. This product was so much cheaper. It's Arm & Hammer so I thought I could trust it to be gentle and work. It doesn't work at all!!! The clothes came out worse than with no softener at all! Luckily you can rewash the nasty blotched clothes adding the Calgon and it will remove any residue, minerals, or soil in the fabric.",negative,washing powder
"I’m not sure if this product is not authentic but it leaves a HORRIBLE residue that permanently damages hard surfaces. I’d hate to see what it would do to clothes. I recently purchased wash dishes as I read articles about how to use it in the dishwasher. I followed the directions and my dishes and dishwasher now have a white, crusty residue that will not wash off. I’ve washed the same load 3x using different products and the residue still hasn’t come off. I even hand washed everything using Dawn and everything is still chalky with water marks. It’s very possible that this product has permanently damaged my dishes and dishwasher. I only say that this product may not be authentic because I couldn’t find anywhere on the web that it could possibly leave a residue or even how to remove it. Lesson learned.",negative,washing powder
I didn't see any difference in my clothes but this product is not to be used in cold water. I did a load of whites in hot water and everything came out fine but when I did colors in cold the powder turns into pieces of crystal that don't dissolve in cold water,negative,washing powder
"Sigh. I was so excited to used this as an alternative to Oxyclean.  My clothes and towels did not get softer; in fact, the towels came out slightly more stiff.Laundry didn't smell especially great (it always seems very fresh with Oxyclean).  After a few weeks, I realized that this product wasn't thoroughly rinsing out of the machine with each cycle, causing an off smell.  I cleared that with a standard bleach-only cycle and went back to Oxyclean.",negative,washing powder
NOT the product size described. Buy it in a store... so much cheaper for the actual large box I wanted,negative,washing powder
When I opened the shipping box the powder was everywhere and the actual arm and hammer box is smashed. The arm&hammer box is inside a bag inside the ship box. The powder is outside the bag its stored. I haven't even used it but it smells great. I just didn't like the fact that the powder is basically wasted.,negative,washing powder
"This has a strong chemical odor similar to Amonia.  It hardens (takes a couple of minutes) as you try and mix it with water.  The water appears to have small black stuff in it. It maybe good for laundry... I haven't tried it for that yet. However, in the kitchen for surfaces, etc. it is completely unacceptable.  It leaves traces of white on surface.  I have a kid at home and I don't like using things with too many chemicals in them.  I bought it to use with cleaning the bathtub but I threw it out.  I don't want to experiment with it.",negative,washing powder
It arrived hard as a rock in box as one big clump.,negative,washing powder
"I was so excited to buy this product and immediately tried it on my towels, and I was impressed that my towels no longer smelled sour - they were actually fresh and clean.  Then I did a load of dark cottons - t-shirts, sweats, etc.  I didn't use very much, only about a quarter of a cup for the whole large load.  It made my entire load of laundry permanently faded and blotched with gray areas.  I ran the load again with only water and vinegar to see if I could rinse it out and strip the cotton of the washing soda, but no, the clothes are permanently damaged.  There is also a ""film"" of the washing soda on the cotton that won't come off, so not only can you see it, you can feel it too.I'm definitely calling the company on this one.",negative,washing powder
"I purchased 2 of these because they are supposed to be unscented - fragrance free. I am shocked that they smell like Tide detergent. I had an asthma attack as soon as I opened them.I received these about December 1, 2019 and had to put them in my basement, hopeful the fragrance odor would be gone in time, but here it is January 6, 2020 and as soon as I opened my basement door, the strong fragrance detergent smell was still very strong.",negative,washing powder
I do not notice a difference using this product with my clothes at all. Waste of money.,negative,washing powder
Both boxes were just thrown into a big box with other products the 2 borax boxes split open powder everywhere,negative,washing powder
"This product, Arm & Hammer Super Washing Soda Detergent Booster & Household Cleaner, is very good for cutting grease and dirty. So good, I bought 6 boxes after my first box. My review is not of the quality of the product rather the cost. Sellers in Amazon Marketplace sell it at $9 to 10 per box 55 oz each. But if you buy the same product same size at Walmart, you pay only $3.24 per box. Walmart Free Shipping is available if purchased $45 or more. $9 per box is unfair. Fortunately Amazon's quality customer service allowed me to return the product at no extra cost.  Be warned...",negative,washing powder
"If I had not needed this product, I would have returned it.  The box was smashed and the detergent had spilled into the plastic bag it was shipped in.",negative,washing powder
No difference this product made!,negative,washing powder
I’m super disappointed.The hole in the box should have been checked before delivery.,negative,washing powder
I will stick to original baking soda wash.,negative,washing powder
"i had difficulty finding washing soda locally as I could not find it at: safeway, CVS, target, home depot, local organic market. I purchased this online to use in homemade dishwashing detergent. Several days after purchasing this I found 55oz arm & hammer washing soda at Wegman's and at Harris Teeter. Wegman's for $3.99 and HT for $2.99 on sale. I was astonished at the low prices after paying nearly $10 for this exact same size. LOOK AROUND before buying this for a 300% mark-up.",negative,washing powder
"I liked this for my towels and sheets, but not my clothes. It's good, gets thing extra clean, but it stains, fades, and discolors dark clothing. I would recommend this product, but just don't use it on your clothes.",negative,washing powder
"This has a scent similar to Tide and causes allergies. Ordered from two different places so it is not how it is stored. If you are sensitive, please look for a different washing soda or soda ash. This is not 100%.",negative,washing powder
There was a bag around the box.  Both the bag and the box had a hole because the baking power leaked out all over the place.,negative,washing powder
When I used the product in my washing machine it solidified. Must have been in warehouse for too long. Amazon refunded my money for product and now I am happy but I would not order this again from Amazon because I think it was in warehouse too long. I will buy it at store.,negative,washing powder
"I didn't pay close enough attention to the size of this product.  I buy this at the store all the time and pay just a little over $3.  I thought for $9 I would be getting a much larger package.  That is not the case.  I could have bought three of the packages at my local store for the same price.  (As for the product, I love it and that is why I keep buying it but never again from Amazon).",negative,washing powder
Love this product but shipping was very hard on the packaging that arrived,negative,washing powder
"These came and were unusable for my laundry mix I make because it was all clumpy and hardened and box swollen a little too! Both boxes were this way, stale",negative,washing powder
"This made my laundry smell bad/worse. Gave it a sharp, acidic, chemical-like smell. Wish I could return it. Regular baking soda doesn't do this.",negative,washing powder
The box was damaged when I received it! Thank good it was in a plastic bag so I was able to savage some of it.😩,negative,washing powder
"Presumably helps with the laundry, but be warned: THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK WELL AS INTIMATE LUBRICANT.  Sure, it will seem OK at first but then you'll both end up with chemical burns that only emerge a day or three later.  USE SILICONE!",negative,washing powder
I ordered boxes of plain soda so I don’t need this...but will eventually try it. I was disappointed that I still need my boxes of plain soda.,negative,washing powder
"My fault, used to clean the floors. Almost ruined. A cloud of white paste and took time after time to try and remove.",negative,washing powder
Box was not intact was in plastic bag but when opened some product spilled out all over ! 😢,negative,washing powder
"It ruined an entire load of my dark clothing, including my favorite shirt. Also left my clothing feeling oddly crispy.",negative,washing powder
One was great. Second one wasn’t packaged correctly by Amazon and was hard as a rock. Clearly the Amazon packager,negative,washing powder
Was a mess when delivered. Product leaked out of it’s container. Will not purchase again.,negative,washing powder
The smell of your clothes after using smells horrible! I was better off just using the regular baking soda that’s used for cooking as well as cleaning. It leaves no awful smell.,negative,washing powder
This is a tiny small box for the same price as a big box at a grocery store. Very disappointed,negative,washing powder
Coated the inside of front loading washing machine. Did not do anything for laundry. Had to run several times with just vinegar and water to remove residue.,negative,washing powder
"Product came damaged, it had something leak all over it and it is ruined.",negative,washing powder
Turned my clothes blue.,negative,washing powder
Pulls color from clothing. Use on whites only is best.,negative,washing powder
Lighten dark color clothes.,negative,washing powder
"This is literally $3.00 in the grocery store if you can find it.  I moved to a new city and couldn't find it, so I got lazy and ordered it online.  I felt betrayed and sad when I found it in the store for 1/3 the price.  :(",negative,washing powder
The laundry wasn't as clean as I thought it would be.,negative,washing powder
The powder was stuck together.,negative,washing powder
Each of the boxes I ordered were hard as rocks,negative,washing powder
Stop sending product,negative,washing powder
"I guess it's a laundry additive, cause by itself,clean does not happen .....",negative,washing powder
"False advertising. Soda is liquid, this is powder",negative,washing powder
Dows not work with cold water washing!  Needs warm or hot water to dissolve.,negative,washing powder
Arrived in a box with no filler- box broken and contents spilled,negative,washing powder
Items left on fence instead of Put in mailbox,negative,washing powder
Way overpriced.  $2.50 in store  I went into wal mart and found this for a quarter of what I paid.  Rip off.,negative,washing powder
Product was misding from the box,negative,washing powder
Was left outside the gate really wet,negative,washing powder
Too small,negative,washing powder
"Just found all three ingredients, in the exact same sizes, for this homemade laundry detergent on ebay for $7 - that includes shipping.  THIS PRICE IS AN ABSOLUTE RIPOFF!!!! STAY AWAY!!!!",negative,washing powder
Wish I would've known that before I purchased but I never will again.,negative,washing powder
"Seller packaged item in plastic with a label for washing soda, but the item is actually baking soda",negative,washing powder
Ordered washing soda received baking soda,negative,washing powder
"Just call your local grocery store and ask them to order a case of this for you.  I got a case of 12 boxes for $35 that way.It's a great product, and when combined with P&G soap and borax does a good job getting clothes clean, but paying this much, or even a lesser price plus shipping, for your ingredients negates any savings you might have achieved by making your own.",negative,washing powder
The box was opened when received.,negative,washing powder
The product arived fast the box was compleatly mangled and the product had spilled out all over my porch lost at least half of it,negative,washing powder
Way overpriced,negative,washing powder
"Great product? Sure. But at this price, you should be getting more.You can get two at a brick and mortor retailer for less than the price of one on Amazon. Some people say to review the product, and not its price. But I say that the price of a product has everything to do with its subjective quality. The least they could do is sell a bulk of them at a discounted price, but even at $22 for three of them, it's still cheaper to get them individually at, say, Walmart for <$4 a piece.",negative,washing powder
"Well, I'm glad I didn't pay what some of you did. The 55oz. box of A&H Washing Soda was at my grocery store, (Market Basket, Raynham, MA) for $2.69. I used it for the first time yesterday along with A&H liquid detergent. When I went to move the washed clothes to the dryer I heard a clanking sound among the wet clothes, saw a glimpse of white, and started wondering how a tea cup saucer got into the wash. The white, pleasant smelling, porceline-like object turned out to be a clump of the washing soda. I pulled a couple of smaller chunks out of the bottom of the washer under the agitator. Weird. The stuff just coagulated for some reason.Arm & Hammer Super Wash Soda, Detergent Booster 55 oz (1559 g)",negative,washing powder
"This price is ridiculous!  It is less than $3.50 at Walmart for the same size box.  I don't like supporting Walmart, but I am not paying three times as much.",negative,washing powder
I agree with the other one stars...in so much I dislike Walmart it is much cheaper there.  Spend your money wisely.,negative,washing powder
GREAT PRODUCT...........Really great product.  I am using it to make my own laundry detergent and I can use it on baby clothes and diapers. I love it.  But...you can get the same size box for under $3.  Shop around.[...][...][...],negative,washing powder
This product tastes absolutely horrible. Like rotten eggs...  ugh.  I'm never buying this again.,negative,washing powder
found this for about $3.00 at Shop Rite.  i have not tried it yet and will be using it to boost my laundry detergent.  i am tired of buying the expensive brands.,negative,washing powder
I paid $24.49 for product on left from Amazon (3lb 7 oz) and $6.99 for product on right from Canadian Tire (6 lb 6oz). The reason I purchased the Amazon product was because I had trouble finding the product in Canada but will definitely stock up any time I find it on the shelves in my local Canadian Tire store!,negative,washing powder
My first purchase was the one on the right. Bye again and received the one on the left! Same price but lot less product. Not happy at all.,negative,washing powder
The box came opened and leaking everywhere,negative,washing powder
Doesn't remove stains and leaves a white residue on dark colored clothing,negative,washing powder
Product of was excellent but unfortunately would not order again as shipping price was very high.  Even if shipping is a legitimate fee it just too costly. Sorry.  Loved the product.,negative,washing powder
"Every time I poured the detergent the 'traditional' way, by putting it within the soap dispenser, or directly on the clothes, it does not dissolve properly, and I had to add another rinse cicle to be able to completely rinse and dissolve the soap.  Since I wasn't going to toss a whole box of the product, I figured a way to deal with it.  I dissolved a scope of it in hot or warm water, and slowly agitate it with a large wood spoon, until it is totally liquid.  It takes about 3 to 5 minutes to dissolve it, and then I added to the washer load.  It works that way!  I'm doing this until I use the whole box, then I won't buy another one!",negative,washing powder
"I was not careful when ordering and inadvertently ordered this Mountain Spring Scent.  Fragrance is a personal issue but I did not like this at all.  I like the original Tide scent because it dissipates quickly but this lingered in the clothes and was, in my opinion, horrible.  It reminded me of those toilet cakes you hang in the loo. I threw out both boxes.  Tried to give it to my neighbors but once they sniffed the product it was a ""no thank you"" response.  Just make sure  you're ordering this fragrance purposefully.",negative,washing powder
"I have been using tide pods for years, but wanted to desperately reduce the use of single plastic containers. So I decided, hey, let me get the tide powder in a cardboard box. Should work just the same, right?Nope. First of all, all my clothes are left half washed, they stink and the powder residue is leaving white stains on a lot of items. This doesn't clean my clothes properly at all and it was such a waste of money. Now, I am ordering the pods again. Do not recommend.",negative,washing powder
"Upon delivery , powder was already spilling out of Amazon box. I kept it, and figured it would be fine. Then I put it in my laundry room and I guess I should have planned better because it is now spilling all over my laundry room. I need to invest in a large jar or container to pour this into to avoid such a mess. I like the detergent but the packaging was lacking.",negative,washing powder
Just go to Walmart. I thought this would be the bug size but no. It's tiny and definitely not worth 20 dollars. Don't buy!,negative,washing powder
"In the fall of 2014 Proctor & Gamble quietly changed the formula for 'Original' scent Tide. Over the next few months angry posts began to appear on Tide's Facebook and other social media pages. Eventually a spokesperson for P&G did confirm the change, claiming that consumer focus groups preferred the 'new' smell. To longtime fans like myself this is baffling:(A) The new smell is terrible. It is inconceivable that any consumer focus panel would choose the new smell over the old.(B) Why would a company silently introduce a change that they believed would improve consumer appeal? If anything one would expect them to trumpet the change through every available outlet.Possible conspiracies aside, it just smells bad. Avoid this product.",negative,washing powder
Opened the box and detergent is split all over the box.,negative,washing powder
Powder is all over allergy pills and even inside the dog bones. Everything is covered,negative,washing powder
"Tide Mountain Spring liquid appears to be sold out everywhere. For those that may not know, Tide changed the Original scent to something terrible and noxious. But they moved the old Original scent to Mountain Spring liquid. However, apparently they didn't do the same thing for the powder version. If you're a fan of the old Original scent, then your only option appears to be the Mountain Spring liquid.",negative,washing powder
"This detergent does not get your clothes clean and the powder does not dissolve. At the end of the rinse cycle,  undissolved detergent remains on your wash.  I had to use an additional rinse cycle to remove the powder residue. I will never use Tide Laundry powder again!",negative,washing powder
Box came broken with powder all over it and down in the bag that it was put it in,negative,washing powder
The laundry soap looks like it got wet the box is very wet and the soap is in clumps I’d like a replacement please,negative,washing powder
"Did not come with a scoop, dug through the whole box and nothing. Used measurements found online, I love Tide products, thought this would be a good way to save money, and I hated it. Felt like the clothes did not smell/feel clean after using. Back to liquid Tide for this family.",negative,washing powder
"Better to buy at store than online. Once package arrived, I Tide had spilt inside the Amazon box and then out of the little whole. Box was missing about a quarter of it when I opened it & was messy.",negative,washing powder
This detergent smells awful! I used Tide before and it doesn’t smell bad. I’m not sure if detergent “goes bad” but it smells like it has. It smells rancid and my clothes smells like it and I cannot return this item!,negative,washing powder
The scent is too strong that gives headache. It stays on fabric even after multiple washes with free and clear ( fragrance free ) detergent.,negative,washing powder
This formula left bleach marks on my clothes. Gave away to someone else to use for white clothes only.  I was too mad to keep and use…,negative,washing powder
"Great product, but poorly packaged! Shipping package was spilling  all over our front sidewalk when delivered. When the shipping box was opened, the Tide box seams were split from top to bottom and then across the Tide box bottom. Big mess!!!!!",negative,washing powder
"The tide washing powder was delivered on 3/22/20 and it was damaged, fortunately it was in side of another larger box, and the soap was contained through-out the larger box, we will keep the product, but needed to let you know that it arrived damaged.",negative,washing powder
My box arrived with a hole in it. I can’t return this. Won’t order again,negative,washing powder
Ruined my black and navy blue clothing! I’ve tried everything to get these stains out from this detergent and nothing has worked. So disappointed. Ruined over $500 in clothing.,negative,washing powder
I ordered the Mountain Spring scent by accident. After a couple of loads I had to discard it. The perfume is overpowering.,negative,washing powder
While the product is good the packaging was poor. It broke open and more than half the contents spilled out. No refund available.,negative,washing powder
,negative,washing powder
Smell is TERRIBLE.  Something is wrong with this box of detergent.,negative,washing powder
"Something was very wrong,keep clogging and very sluggish in my machine",negative,washing powder
"I dont recommend it, thick and clogs home washer. Sticks on clothes and wont wash out.",negative,washing powder
"Scent is aweful. Musty foul scent,",negative,washing powder
Box was torn apart with detergent everywhere. Would not buy this again.,negative,washing powder
"soap works well but box not packed well,  box was damaged and spilled out everywhere",negative,washing powder
L2 cups of powder came out on top of the box.,negative,washing powder
Damaged,negative,washing powder
Box opened. Not sealed well.  Outer box as well.,negative,washing powder
Packaging was damaged. Contents spilled. Extensive cleanup required.,negative,washing powder
spilled all over,negative,washing powder
"The product information section specifically reads ""HE for High Efficiency Machines"". The box that I received is NOT for HE machines. I am returning the item. Very disappointed in the complete inaccuracy of the description.",negative,washing powder
Was not ultra,negative,washing powder
Gave me a nasty rash. This is the only laundry detergent that has ever given me a rash. Beware.,negative,washing powder
"I did not realize they still sell this kind of detergent, I have not seen it for at least 10 years",negative,washing powder
"Esta mal el anuncio del detergente. Dice que el paquete es de 4.8 kg, cuando en realidad es de 4.08kg. Seria conveniente que corrigiera esta situación.",negative,washing powder
"I recently purchased the Oxy Clean Order Blast and was excited to try it out. However, when I received the package in the mail, I was disappointed to find that the top was open and half the product had spilled out of the box. I was extremely upset by this, as I had paid for a full product and now had less than half to use.This was very frustrating and left a negative impression on my overall experience with the product.Overall, I was disappointed by my experience with the Oxy Clean Order Blast. While the product may be effective, the fact that it arrived in such poor condition was unacceptable.",negative,washing powder
So i love the product itself but i do not love receiving it busted open and all over (possibly inside) a product I consume. This is the 2nd time thos has happened to me and I am not happy about it. Guess i wont buy this product from here since I cant recieve it in decent shape.  😞,negative,washing powder
"This is the second time I have ordered an Oxi product. The first time it spilled and was returned by the handling agent. This time, the item came spilled into a plastic bag. My husband found a plastic container that will hold the mixture. I will not order any more from Oxi.There was absolutely nothing to seal the lid. These products may have come from second parties buying defective products, but I don’t care. I will not buy except from a physical store.",negative,washing powder
Mfg failed to tape top of container to  the container - the top came off the containers & the product spilled all over the shipping box rendering the contents useless.  It was so disappointing!  Almost all of the other products I purchase that could come loose are taped closed..  This is the 3rd time thjs has happened to me with Oxyclean.  The reorder came the same way.  I guess you should only buy 1 or 2 boxes at a time.,negative,washing powder
"Very frustrated, I paid over $10 for this and when I received it, the powder was everywhere. Container wasn't sealed properly and it was a very big mess to clean. The container itself has very little powder left in it.",negative,washing powder
"Didn’t even open this box. Upon delivery the box looked like Ace Ventura himself handled it. The packing tape holding the box closed had Oxiclean stuck to it, and it was leaking out of one of the corners too.",negative,washing powder
The product works awesome. It really works on stains and makes the clothes smell wonderful. The packing used to come with individually wrapped containers that had a safety strap on the lid. It no longer does and the last 2 shipments have had all 3 containers open and all over the inside of the box. Probably had something to do with the box being thrown on my door step but I can’t be sure. I was able to make 2 full containers out of the spilled mess in the boxes. I used to order these as subscribe and save but I’m deleting it from my list now. This is completely on Amazons end.,negative,washing powder
"Item arrived completely empty had spilt in the box and obviously out of the box because what was in the box wasn’t even a 3rd of the powder. The value for money is okay, and I’ve never had any issues with this item before.",negative,washing powder
"Packaging is always damaged and the product is spilled inside the package. Even after return/refund for a new one that was in the same or worse condition.  Each time I have to pour the product back inside. Also, it sticks to the outside of the canister, which makes a mess everywhere, so I have to wash and dry the counters and the container.  Other stores tape the lid down, so this doesn't happen.",negative,washing powder
"DECEMBER 2022: Exchanged 1st order because it arrived damaged, 2nd order did too. Gave up and had them refund it. Great product just buy from the store",negative,washing powder
"I love Oxiclean, but Amazons packaging sucks. This is the 2nd time I’ve received it like this",negative,washing powder
"The product itself is fantastic and I have no complaints. However, I likely won’t be using Amazon to get it any longer. I receive this every month, along with other oxyclean products, and it is hit or miss whether it will be packaged correctly. I received a shipment today and there was no tape around the seal, so the top had opened and most of the product was gone. Either at the bottom of the box or had poured out of the shipping box. Obviously, bringing it in the house tracked a huge mess, and dealing with it took almost half an hour. To get a refund, I would have to send the half-empty box back through the mail and spend another half an hour dealing worth it. Unless they can figure out a consistent shipping process for these things, it’s easier to just get this during my grocery runs.",negative,washing powder
"I've been using other odor-eliminating detergent boosters for a year or two (like Nature's Miracle and Rockin' Green Active Wear). Those have worked really well, but the cost adds up. Someone recommended OxyClean and I saw this option specifically for odors. I expected it to at least work. It didn't.I tried it on some towels that didn't smell especially bad, just a little musty. Well, they came out smelling just as musty, but with a sickening synthetic stench on top of it.So then I thought, ""Maybe it'll work better for soaking."" Nope. I soaked some workout clothes over night (started with hot water). They came out smelling like I'd just finished a workout, then fallen inside a cotton candy machine. Just BO and nauseating synthetic fragrance. I'll definitely be sticking to the more expensive (but effective) detergents I've been using.",negative,washing powder
"I like the product, if only it had not spilled into the box.",negative,washing powder
Came open was spilling all over when I  pick up box  ones it was drop off open box and found container  open,negative,washing powder
Mine came with no odor busters .  My first purchase came with blue and white detergent....smelled great.  Second one...all white.  No odor busters.  Will get from different buyer.  Not good!!I gave it another shot.  No odor busters again.  I think they are sending the rejects.,negative,washing powder
This does not make anything smell clean. It reeks of artificial whatever gunk! I prefer my moldy dog blankets to this disgusting smell!,negative,washing powder
"Do not waste your time,I JUST WASTED MY MONEY  next time I  will go inside the store to buy, omg I just can not believe I wasted my money, both of them was already opened, so that mean it is not sealed of packaged secure enough....I have always ordered household items from amazon and they always come unopened and very securely packed...all the product  was in the box it was a waste...I am so upset...I will say it smell so so so so so so good...this was my first time buying this...I have not washed with it because packaged came late, but I am sure it will smell good and get clothes clean.......I guess it does not come with a lot because it's not even filled up all the way",negative,washing powder
The container was NOT sealed properly. Most of the product was spilled inside the carton. Made a big mess inside the house.,negative,washing powder
"I love this product but this is how it came to me. What!? Better handling instructions for carrier, bubble pack, tape the lid down, many ways to have helped avoid this. There's even a hole in the plastic bag! I've definitely lost some of this and I have to make a mess trying to recover what I can.",negative,washing powder
Product is great BUT wasn’t packaged separately or wrapped to keep spillage off other products in same box…I had a genuine MESS on my hands and all over my porch and thru my house just carrying it in.,negative,washing powder
"Everyone should know that the ""Odor Blaster"" scent is uncommonly potent. I am saying resonates through the house  air freshener style potent. If you want that, good for you, this is the stuff. If that sounds a little strong, I agree. If you are anything like me, sensitive to strong air fresheners and perfumes, then STAY AWAY from this stuff. Just to be clear, we use the regular scented oxiclean regularly. With this Odor Blaster stuff I am headache, watering eyes, extreme running nose 5 minutes after walking in my front door. That is after rewashing everything that this was used on and cleaning the floors etc. Yep, that bad. Never had a reaction like this to any other laundry soaps or additives.",negative,washing powder
This was spilled everywhere and we lost most of it and it was frustrating to clean!,negative,washing powder
"So this product does its job as far as stains, but beware the Odor Blasters.  Whether or not the cleaning agent actually gets rid of an odor would be impossible to tell because once treated with this product, the ""Classic Clean Scent"" smell is overpowering and (for me) very disagreeable. Maybe you like the smell, but be advised, you will not get rid of it. My assumption of the meaning of that moniker was that there was some cleaning agent that would remove an oder; I have used the oxy product for cleaning purposes, Hydrogen Pyroxide eats up all kinds of organic things, and getting rid of odor was never primary to my needs.  In fine print on the bend of the container it says ""Classic Clean Scent,"" and had I seen that I might have avoided this product.",negative,washing powder
I love oxi clean but I'm not using this vendor anymore. This is now the 2nd time my shipment came in with tons wasted and a huge mess bc they didn't tape the lid down and put no packing materials so it slammed around and came open.,negative,washing powder
The product came broken and all spilled out of the container,negative,washing powder
I bought this several times and always arrives in great condition this last time it was wrapped in plastic had a whole and the lid had opened all of my product was all over the box must have had a very rough transport but there was barely any packing material very disappointed but will continue to buy even with this experience it truly helps the clothing smell fresher.,negative,washing powder
                    The media could not be loaded.                 Product had no safety seal. Half of the product spilled in the box. No damage to the actual box. Looks like someone sent me a opened/used product.,negative,washing powder
,negative,washing powder
Package came busted and all spilt in the box,negative,washing powder

I received the Oxi Clean on time but the lid was not secured nor was it packaged in a leak proof bag and it spilled out in the box which got wet. I ended up with only half of the Oxi Clean left in the container. Very disappointed the seller did not even tape the lid to keep from popping open. The product it self works great.,negative,washing powder
It did take the the smell out of some some old t shirts and such but when I washed some fuzzy blankets and throws what a mess. Now my lint filter in my dryer which is a speed queen not cheap the granules of the oxy powder dropped through the filter and I can see it there. Now I need someone to unscrew the lint filter so I can vac it out. Would never buy oxy again.,negative,washing powder
November - 2020 -- !!!big problem!!! - does not dissolve properly clogs washing machine and drain ...=====================================================================This is a good laundry booster with a pleasant smell ... like all powder boosters a bit of a pain having to fill the machine and add powder before adding clothes but such is the inconvenience for saving a substantial amount of money overall vs. liquid - works as well as other boosters I've used - can't really tell that it's any better or worse.  Overall a very good value for the money.,negative,washing powder

I have tried to Explain this to Amazon, but no one seems to be listening to my complaint.  Both the first and 2nd boxes of Oxyclean left trails of Oxyclean from my front porch to my laundry room and was all over the other items that also came in the first box.  The lid sucks.  Oxyclean needs a better lid or a special seal around the lid like those that come on some bottles.  Whomever puts on the plastic bag around the Container of Oxyclean needs to put one that will not burst or have holes.  Not knocking the Oxyclean granules themselves, they work well but are a pain to vacuum up.",negative,washing powder

It was shipped in a plastic bag which would normally be good except for the fact the bag had holes in it! So the lid came off and the bag was full of powder. I thought well it'll be ok I'll just pour it back into the container. No! I picked it up and was taking it out of the box and powder was pouring out all over because i didn't see the holes in the bag and it had poured out inside the box while being shipped also!

"Maybe the product is ok but they really have to work out better packaging or shipping because this is ridiculous. The container explosion was probably anticipated because it was in a clear ""ready to ship"" bag, inside of an Amazon shipping bag, inside another Amazon shipping bag.

As I now see I'm not the only one with this issue.,negative,washing powder
"Whomever packaged this just threw it in a box and sealed it. The lid came off, probably when it was delivered, and I had a boxful of soap I had to put back into the open container. One thing about this version of  OXY Clean, it says odor buster, but it covers odor with a HEAVY PERFUME. If you are like me, and your skin is allergic to certain soaps, dyes and perfumes,  NO NOT purchase this version. I will revert to the original version.",negative,washing powder
The product is wonderful! I have purchased it before but I like the Amazon price much better however I didn’t even get to use the product this time due to packing issues.

The lid on this thing is atrocious. A nudge sends it and a whole bunch of product falling out! I've only done two washes and every single time a bunch of stuff is slipping out. To prevent this I now have to now walk holding only the oxyclean to keep from anything spilling out.Maybe they want you to run through it quicker?,negative,washing powder

"For me, I don't find this to work any better than the regular Oxi-clean. Furthermore, it leaves a very strong, unnatural floral scent that does NOT dissipate after washing and drying.

I like to use an Oxy product as a booster in my washing machine.  I did not realize when I ordered this product that it leaves a scent on your clothing after the wash.

The package was good it come sealed in a plastic bag to make sure if the tub breaks during shipping it won't be spilled all over there was some that had spilled but not a ton there also wasn'tany bubble wrap or anything in the box to prevent the tub from sliding around in the box during shipping. It smells good out of the tub but doesn't work well for washing I have followed the directions and I have even added more or less to the load to see if it would change but it doesn't seem to make clothes smell good unfortunately I could basically be washing my clothes with plain water I am a bit disappointed I won't be ordering or buying this product again..,negative,washing powder

"I really have no complaints about the soap but the box was spilling all over inside the bag while shipping and I thought the reason was that it was shipped upside down but the packer knew what I learned over time and that is that the box had a faulty bottom and was dropping its contents out the bottom every time I tipped it to use it! While shipping, of course, it was in a bag, so, no biggie. But, to use it at home, I can't keep it in a bag all the time so I have a mess that is very very problematic as a mother of two children under TWO. Hopefully it is just a fluke, but I am not impressed that a box that was obviously known to have a major flaw was shipped out that way.",neutral,washing powder

"Needs better packaging. Twice, I have ordered this product and it arrives leaking contents. The product itself is great, no complaints there. The first time it arrived in a box about the same size as the product. It had been dropped or banged on a corner, causing the contents to leave a trail of dust everywhere. The second time, it arrived in a padded envelope. Same thing. It's not a fragile item, I'm not expecting it to be wrapped in bubble wrap, but some cushioning to kept the box intact and not have washing soda all over my laundry room floor would be nice.

I bought this product to raise the alkalinity in my swimming pool. It worked as it should and I was satisfied with those results however when I used it in my washing machine it didn't want to dissolve when I put it in before I started the clothes.

This has NO culinary uses! Perhaps whatever slight fragrance is there was added to remind people that this is ONLY a cleaning agent! The write-up on this here does not help; yes, you can make sodium carbonate out of sodium BIcarbonate, so that's probably how they made it in the first place on an industrial level, but you can't go back the other way, and you CAN'T use them interchangeably!Basically, if you follow along with everyone putting it into their pools to raise the pH high enough to be a substitute for chlorine treatments, or even an additive, that should be a red flag.

"When the baking soda came, the box was very big which I was very happy about. I loved that their was a plastic bag around the baking soda box to prevent the baking soda from spilling everywhere, even though, some still came out. I got this because my clothes had a weird odor that would never come out, no matter what I tried. This unfortunately did not work at all, in fact, it just made things a whole lot worse. I did try washing my shoes with it and it did get rid of old stains and dirt. This works mainly for stains and not really for odors. The box will definitely last a really long time.I like that only a little bit comes out when you are pouring it so too much doesn’t come out. I love that it isn’t just for laundry, you can use it for so many things, such as cleaning, laundry, cleaning your tub, etc.",neutral,washing powder

"I purchased this because it was presented as Tide Powder Original, in the bottom left corner of the box it says Active Lift. This is the actual original scent of Tide powder for years. Last year for whatever, Tide decided it was better to change the scent with a different formula called Clean Dissolve. It simply did not have that awesome clean scent and leave clothes smelling as such. The scent is more perfumy and weak at that. Clothes have no scent, clean or otherwise. It's just not the same. I asked in the questions if it was the older version the latest version, and no one could answer, so I took a chance. I'm returning it because this new Tide just isn't the same.",neutral,washing powder
"Powder detergent actually does a better job of cleaning laundry. This is the first time I ever bought powder, and this is what I’ve learned:- It works best for large loads or those washed in warm/hot water. I’ve found clumps of detergent left in the washing machine after loads using cold water.- It is not portable at all. The box is designed to open at the top like a hinged lid. The design makes sense because one of the reasons liquid detergent replaced powder is that the detergent clumps and you can’t get it all out of a box with a spout opening on the side. But if you plan to do your laundry at a laundromat, you’ll have to scoop some into a plastic bag.- I think it does perform very well, better than liquid, at cleaning. But the smell, OMG, the smell. It’s awful. Clothes dried with a scented fabric softener sheet aren’t so bad, but I washed a windbreaker with it and hung it to dry and the smell lingered on the jacket and made my hallway stink for days.I wanted to try washing my floors with it because I’ve read glowing reviews of its use for that purpose, but there’s no way I could live with my entire apartment smelling like this detergent. Also, you have to go over the floors mopping with just water afterward, and I don’t even like mopping the floors once, never mind twice.",neutral,washing powder

"Not as good as it used to be when my Mom used Tide all growing up. This one is hit or miss and sometimes leaves the clothes feeling kind of like the soap didn't rinse all the way out but I used the correct amount per the instructions and load size. Don't add Oxy stuff to it, though, because then the detergent never lathers. Best for top loading washers. Front loaders suck and they stink and the soap never dissolves as well, either. I feel like they changed the formula over the years. Just like McDonald's fries after they took out the trans fat. Never the same.",neutral,washing powder
"This laundry soap did get our laundry nice and clean with a pleasant fragrance.I did not like that it came in just a thin plastic bag, like a bag of chips and no measuring cup.  Also the instructions on how much to use are not accurate.we have a 5 cu. ft. HE front load washer, and I had an extra large load. It says to use a full cup for large/extra large loads- and that was nearly overflowing the powder detergent compartment, but I decided to follow the instructions and see.That was definitely too much and I had to run the load again with no soap in it, in order to rinse the excess soap out.I would say that half cup to 3/4 cup would be the correct amount for your extra large loads.",neutral,washing powder
"It seems that receiving this package intact is an ongoing issue. The container was strapped shut, bagged and tied, but still leaked out into the bag, box, and onto other products shipped at the same time (if you’re going to order, order this one item only so it ships in its own box). Not a major loss, as there was about a cup of material in the box that I threw out instead of trying to use. The rest remained in the plastic bag  (around another cup ) and I simply threw that into the laundry. The container itself arrived intact, but the lid appears to not have a strong enough hold on the container for it to be shipped.As for the smell, it’s very strong. While the product may work well in removing stains and odors, I will not be using it again because of the scent. It’s too overwhelming.

Oxiclean took the smell out on the first wash. However, I took away 2 stars because the packaging is awful. It arrived opened with the lid off and half the contents spilled into the box.

Unfortunately the cover came off the oxiclean and spilled into the bag that covered it.  The bag has a hole in it and the powder spilled across the kitchen floor before we noticed what a mess we had gotten.,neutral,washing powder
"I like the product but Holy cow did someone mess up with packaging. This arrived to me completely open with powder everywhere. It even got in my dog chews and I'll have to return them now because I fear there is oxyclean all over them. Super disappointed, was really looking forward to this package today.",neutral,washing powder
This is the second time of ordering this product. This time the product was open and spilled in the box. Only about 15% was spilled in the box.,neutral,washing powder
My husband likes to wear sport material pilot shirts that absorb deodorant and funky smells like crazy. I turned them inside put and soaked in warm water and this oxyclean as directed. I even scrubbed at the armpits with a bristle brush a few times. Then washed. It didn't work. Still funky.,neutral,washing powder
I really love oxyclean I love the clean smell and everything. but I was very disappointed because when I got my order it was completely open everywhere in the box .and my box was leaking outside with powder everywhere it would be nice if they would tape it or something .so it would not leak but I just re-ordered again so I hope it don’t happen again. Product cost too much without not being sealed,neutral,washing powder
"I have ordered this product numerous times, however, this time the the top was  loose and the much of the product came out.  I actually was able to put lots of it back into the container and didn't lose all the product.  That's my only complaint.  Who doesn't love Oxy?",neutral,washing powder
"I love OxyClean but I've never used this form of it before.  My husband and I have allergies and generally avoid strong scents.  I've thought about seeing if a neighbor could use the rest of my container.If you generally use fabric softener, the smell of this probably won't bother you at all.",neutral,washing powder
"This detergent powder does not mix easily with warm water. You need to stir the water a lot to get most of powder particles dissolve in water. Results after 6 hours of soaking white shirt with stained collar some what ok. This doesn't remove the stain on collar completely but Half of it. When soaking over night, shirt is more clean.",neutral,washing powder
I love the product of course lol however when I got it in my order it was everywhere all over everything so I did not get the full container. I don’t know if I’d order again bc of that,neutral,washing powder
Great product. Poor packaging it arrived broken and spilled all over!,neutral,washing powder
"So the product is awesome.  I have no complaints about the product.  The 3 stars is for the shipping.  As some people have pointed out. When boxes are thrown this container cracks.  Amazon had a plastic bag around the product because they must have been told about this issue.  However, I just had the bad luck of the plastic having a hole so the detergent still made a mess in the box and at least a fourth of it was lost.  I have order this before and it was the first time it happened.  Just know it could happen.",neutral,washing powder
"I understand things are difficult due to what's happening but there is no reason to ship a product this way. If anything, you could have tape it shut to prevent this kind of a mess. I'm only giving it 3 stars because this stuff does it job and I received my package in time. My clothes smell good and got rid of the stains that I had difficultly removing. Also, if anyone is wondering, I got my product by Amazon.com Services LLC.",neutral,washing powder
"Really good product. Shipping was ridiculous. The cap had fallen off and powder spilled everywhere, including through the box and all over my doormat and floor.  They really should seal the product. I will buy again, but won’t order online.",neutral,washing powder
The stuff is great and it doesn’t bother me or my husband at all but if you have sensitive skin maybe try something different. Give my kiddo a pretty bad rash and we had to rewash everything.,neutral,washing powder
"Love oxyclean but the shipping wasn’t satisfactory. There was spilled oxyclean everywhere , the top popped off, there was a hole in the bag so it ended up on the floor—just a unnecessary debacle. But, the product itself is fabulous.",neutral,washing powder
"Soaked my workout clothes and sheets overnight in the OxiClean and they were definetly much cleaner and got the sweat smell out, however the perfume scent that is left behind is way too strong. I would purchase again if there is an unscented version.",neutral,washing powder
"I normally use the Oxi Clean White Revive, I don't use bleach. I switched to this because even tho my white towels & washcloths were looking good they weren't smelling that good. First use of the Odor Blaster & the towels seemed to smell fresher, longer, however the washcloths still had makeup on them; a problem we didn't have with the white revive. So I'm not sure how I feel about this. I guess I will have to alternate each load between odor blaster & white revive. I just hope the white revive can get the set in makeup out of the washcloths...",neutral,washing powder
"The spray was not available in the stores, so I bought the powder. It has a strong scent and doesn't clean as well as the spray. Won't buy it again, unless I can't get the spray.",neutral,washing powder

"This stuff is amazing!  But when I got it this time, (this is my second order from amazon)  the lid wasn't on the container and all of the oxiclean was sitting in the box and leaking out.Needless to say, I was frustrated.The first container had tape wrapped around the lid, holding it on the container.  The second one didn't have any tape on it.",neutral,washing powder
Glad that it was shipped in a bag inside the box because the top of the container came off and product was spilling out a little. It wasn’t terrible but still messy.,neutral,washing powder
The lid came off inside the box and half the product spilled inside the box and a lot of it poured out of the box.  The lid needs to be secured better for shipping and placed in a plastic bag in the box.  Otherwise it smells great and does a great job.,neutral,washing powder
The product arrived busted! I had sent it to my son who is in the military! It spilled all over his bed! But will re-order because I love the product!!,neutral,washing powder
The tub was open in the box and half the contents leaked out of the box and onto my porch and living room floor.,neutral,washing powder
Not sure I'll buy again. Product good but second time I had this happen. There wasn't even a bag on it in case of spills. Went everywhere.,neutral,washing powder
This product is amazing for getting odors our and removing stains. Anyone else that says otherwise is full of it. The scent is perfect as well. The only gripe i got and why it lost 2 stars is that whoever ships it out seriously needs to get their sh!t together and add a few pieces of tape to hold the lid down and prevent it from spilling during shipping.,neutral,washing powder
"Cleans well, but I wish they had a fragrance free option. The smell lingers for quite a long time.",neutral,washing powder
I like the product but upon delivery;  one was open and  some of the product was lost.,neutral,washing powder
I like the product…but not the fact that the container opened during shipping.,neutral,washing powder
Product opened and spilled EVERYWHERE. There was no tape or anything keeping the lid on for shipping. Smells nice at least.,neutral,washing powder
The Oxi clean is great but I gave it 3 stars because of Amazon's shipping. They sent it in a bag inside the box but I guess it opened and spilled out. It tore through the bag and there was Oxi clean everywhere!,neutral,washing powder
"Does not dissolve very easily.  Large scoop, not to be full for each load.",neutral,washing powder
Thankfully they put it in a bag in the box because it was open and spilling!!!! And even though it was in a bag it was leaking in the box all over the other products it came in with,neutral,washing powder
Love the product and have never had an issue when ordered but this time the lid opened and went everywhere. Thats why its not getting 5 stars.,neutral,washing powder
"Product is fine, I love using this. I thought buying a larger container online was a good idea...beware! There is no seal on the lid and the product spills everywhere.I did 3 stars only because of the container design. There needs to be a seal or something to keep the lid on better.",neutral,washing powder
I love this stuff and have it on my monthly subscription but about every other delivery ends up looking like this when I get it-opened and spilled all in the bag that it comes in. Thank goodness they do put it in a sealable bag or more than half the product would be gone. Maybe amazon should try taping down the lid?,neutral,washing powder
When my package came it was leaking the powder everywhere 1/2 the containers are empty.,neutral,washing powder
Container was open and powder spilled all out in the box. Poor job of packaging.,neutral,washing powder
It was like I was using regular detergent. It did nothing but add a weird smell to my clothes.,neutral,washing powder
The lid is horrible. When I move the container to use it pops off. I cant really even tell when the top is clicked on. Needs a more substantial lid with a flip top that is only half of lid. Hope to never have it tumble to the ground...,neutral,washing powder
My intentions was to use this item for cleaning clothes. But when i opened the box half of the powder was out of the package.,neutral,washing powder
Every time I get this delivered the top comes off and there is Oxi Clean gets all over the place. Leaves a trail outside my door. I however I do love the Oxi clean itself,neutral,washing powder

Need better sealing method. The little stickers weren’t enough to keep it closed during shipment. Luckily I saved 80% of it.,neutral,washing powder
"I really like this product as I use it frequently to soak baby/kids clothes and it actually does a pretty good job at getting stains out. However, this time, I purchased it from amazon and there was powder leaking all over. When I opened the box, the lid had come off and I lost a good amount of product.",neutral,washing powder
The lid was cracked.  1/2 the powder was in the bag and when we poured it back in container lost a good part of the powder.,neutral,washing powder
I usually buy oxiclean versatile but this was cheaper so I decided to try it. It seems to work as well as versatile but I do not like the smell. I love the fact versatile is odor free as I am sensitive to smells. This smell is especially bothersome to me. I plan to switch back to versatile after we finish this package.,neutral,washing powder
Love how Oxiclean works. I buy it all the time to use for laundry and general cleaning around the home. This odor blaster version is great for clothes/linens needing to be washed during toilet training and Oxiclean in general gets all sorts of stains out of kid's playclothes. I don't agonize over grass/dirt stains anymore.,neutral,washing powder
"I love this product but AMAZON was careless boxing it. It opened and got all over my other products in the box. In the past, they usually wrap it in plastic.  Ugh! Spent 30 minutes cleaning up the mess!!!!",neutral,washing powder

"I bought this product for my gym clothes after an Amazon customer mentioned using it to clean/deodorize  Vibram Fivefinger shoes. However, for someone used to scent-free detergent, this OxiClean is rather too fragrant. Will not use again even in smaller doses. Will look for a more subtly-scented version if available.",neutral,washing powder

Lid wasn't on all of the way so part of the product was spilled out in the box.,neutral,washing powder

"I have 4 kids- all boys. I’m constantly telling them to use their napkins & eat over their plates. Do they? Of course not. I use my little green machine to clean their dinner chairs monthly along with other upholstery cleaners but they were permanently stained… or so I thought. I was ready to just replace the chairs but I got to thinking how amazing this product works on keeping my whites bright & getting stains out of my kids clothes. So I figured I’d try it out. SO glad I did!! Used a spoon of this with warm water along with a soft bristle brush and waaa-la!! They look good as new & saved me a couple hundred on new chairs! BEST $5 ever spent! I’m ready to use this on everything in my house now!*FYI- after years of shopping on amazon, this is the only review I’ve ever done because I’m THAT in love with the product!

"I just bought it to try to add to our loads since we have hard water so I add it for prewashand then added extra rinse to the cycle to  make sure all suds will be rinsed out.It works perfectly!The loads now come perfect every single time .It does NOT HAVE ANY SCENTS! Which is SUPER important because of allergies.We use scent free detergent and we pair it with this soda so it works ideal.Our front loader washer had this horrible smell and we could not find what was the problembut after every load the washer was smelling kind of musty like old basement and the longerform the wash the more smell. We tried many things to fix it of course starting with dryingthe drum to  the bone and also drying any pooled water from the rubber rim that insulatesthe round window in front. Nothing really worked.Then we figured to try to open and drain the washer after daily loads were finished for the dayand turned that our VERY expensive washer had about a gallon of water sitting inside somewherein the tubbing or something and would never drain perfectly even if there was  NO indication there was some water in it. We came to this realization by accident when just for the sake of maintenance we wanted to drain the washer per instruction manual. It was shocking to see the water inside. Then we were curiousif it took long time to accumulate it or does it happen after every load. Turn that it was happening regularly. So from this moment on we just simply open the front flip and let the washer drain intoa little plastic tub we got form dollar store and keep it for the purpose. The change is huge but there was still bit of smell. So when I started adding this Soda Powder to the was the whole smell problem DISSAPEARED like magic.  I also now run the washer with just it in it and turn off the cycle mid cycle and let it run and stop few times once a month or so for hour or so and that gets all the stuff that might accumulate in the plastic drum that holds our metal stainless drum with holes so we don't even see that the housing for it is actually plastic and it can harbor smelly bacteria. WE are really thrilled that thissoda helped us so much. Now when I drain the water it never even smell and before there was always some smell of drain pipe. That  alone is precious!!!I am really super thrilled with it and wrote this as maybe it can help others who deal with the sameproblem of the front loader smelling like moldy pipes. It sure was dangerous and now we don't have a problem anymore.Super Washing Soda saved us lots of frustration and helped us solve big health hazard problem.Considering that we run our laundry every day and there was really no time for stuff to grow from our perspective, yet we now know that the water must have been pooling somewhere where it never drained so now that thing simply disinfects it and creates adverse condition for mold to grow. Also draining paired with this helps immensely.",positive,washing powder

"The first time I purchased this soda, I was hoping to make my husband's work clothes cleaner. We were already using an oxi powder and Borax along with detergent, and this soda ash didn't really help.Then our old washing machine broke and we had to get a new, and of course all you can get are high efficiency machines these days. They need to be cleaned more often than I'm used to, about once a month. I've been cleaning them with 1/2 cup of this Arm & Hammer soda ash and 1/2 cup of baking soda, and putting it on the clean cycle, and it works great. The musty smell is gone, and so is the residue on the inside of the tub. I'm really pleased with how well it works to clean our washing machine.",positive,washing powder

"It does what it is supposed to. I found a recipe to make my own dishwasher detergent pods and laundry pods (different recipe). This stuff works great. For anyone who might want the recipe for dishwasher pods:2 cups super washing soda2 cups borax1/2 cup epsom salt1/2 cup vinegar (put in second to last, 1 tbsp at a time to minimize fizzing)15-20 drops of lemon essential oil (put in last)The vinegar will fizz a little bit, but not much. Make sure it is all mixed thoroughly. Transfer into your favorite silicone mold. I found silicone ice cube trays. Let them set at least overnight, but up to 24 hours to make sure they are good and hard. Pop them out and put into a container, preferably airtight. Only reach in to grab one with DRY HANDS. If they get wet, they'll stick to each other. 1 pod for a regular load, 2 for bigger or dirtier loads. Safe for your dishwasher.They have other recipes online, if you don't like this one, find one you like. You can make a lot at a time and switch up the oils you use. I like to use lemon on the dishes. Enjoy saving some money! :)I'll update once I have mastered a recipe for laundry pods!",positive,washing powder

"Growing up, my Mother used this frequently as we had what she said was ""hard"" water. I'm following her example and I am amazed at the cleanliness of my clothes. I wash strictly in cold water to save on my heating costs for the hot water tank. This states to use the hottest water possible for the items you're washing. So, I add a half cup into a 2 cup measuring glass and fill it with hot water to dissolve it before I add it to my wash. Wow is all I can say. My whites are so much brighter than using bleach which is bad for the rubber water lines of my washing machine. (Bleach eats away at the tubing). Some stains I thought were permanent are gone..

But since it's been retired this is a great second option to remove body oil.Details:Currently searching for solutions to get body odor out of my workout shirts and some synthetic clothing. I thought I had a deodorant or soap problem, then I found out I had a laundry detergent problem.Using my tub to soak ""clean clothes"" overnight (see ""laundry stripping"") was the only thing that successfully removed the offensive odors, and the scent smells like nothing, and is super fresh, which is awesome, and what clean clothes should smell like.I should not have to cover up my clothes with the scent of tropical punch to hide grungy body oil smells.Note that this can be semi-irritating. Wear rubber gloves when swishing the water around to dissolve, etc.But it works great in a soaking scenario.",positive,washing powder

"Followed directions: one gallon hot water with two tablespoons washing soda. Soaked two white pillow protectors that I could never get white again, (even after bleaching and hanging in the sun).  After a two hour soak, the water turned dark tan. The water even had a faint scent of perspiration. The two year old cover was stain free. I soaked the 4 year old cover again and the water remained almost clear, but only very faint stains remained. Threw them both in the washer with a few towels. After drying, the covers were soft and smelled great. This washing soda will make a great addition to a load of athletic wear in the washing machine.",positive,washing powder

"My grocery store has stopped selling this product, and I don’t like to do laundry without it.  I am super sensitive to odors, and this washing soda is the best to remove all odors from clothing.  Everything I wash with it comes out great.  I am so glad Amazon has it available.",positive,washing powder

"I tried everything to get a really strong dryer sheet type perfume scent out of a dress that I bought 2nd hand.  The dress is beautiful but the perfume odor filled my entire room. I tried soaking in vinegar solution overnight, then regular baking soda. scent was still there. So, I soaked the dress overnight (about 12 hours actually) then laundered per the directions on box. No scent!! Completely gone and fresh smelling. this product is the BOMB.",positive,washing powder

Stripping Whites is trending. I checked Pinterest and watched YouTube to learn the process. Some YouTubers said baking soda would be just as effective for cleaning your whites is just as effective as this product but it’s not.

"Wow!  Kudos to Amazon Reviewer Courtney Hollan for sharing the ""Laundry Stripping"" recipe.  My laundry, touched by the magic of A&H Washing Soda, reaches a new level of freshness and clean.  Like a light Spring breeze, it's a wonderful new experience that you'll have to try.The recipe worked for me with both expensive and budget laundry detergents.  7th Generation, All Free & Clear, A&H Free & Clear, and even budget Purex Free & Clear yielded similar excellent results.",positive,washing powder

We use Arm & Hammer laundry booster to get laundry clean and keep our clothes looking new. Excellent product that truly works.,positive,washing powder
Magic wonder product! It’s more effective than oxiclean. Use it to pre soak your yucky clothes and use a scoop in your wash and clothes come out squeaky clean. I soak my husbands gross work clothes in them and the water is disgusting grey/brown. Then use in the wash and they look new. No pit or sweat stains anymore!!,positive,washing powder

"ETA: I've now been subscribing for delivery of the washing soda, 3 boxes e/ mo., to my son in TX for over a year and he SO appreciates it. Walmart there is almost always sold out when he gets a chance to go shopping. And it's just about the same price, so it's not a big deal. He learned that he didn't need to buy fabric softener, bleach, or anything else to do his laundry and keep things fresh and clean. Detergent, washing soda, and white vinegar, and everyone's clothes are bright, stain-free, and even the towels smell fresh every time.Now it's my younger son's turn. He works as a lineman. It wasn't so bad during the start of last year (March 2021) when the temps were cool. However, once Summer began the sweating and dirt really became an issue. I showed him that it could be tamed with just the same formula: laundry detergent, washing soda, and white vinegar. At first, he wasn't completely convinced but after a few days of my sneezing fits when he'd walk by me (he still used dryer sheets on his clothes or the kids') convinced him otherwise. Now he's teaching the boys (ages 7 and 9) how he does the laundry so that ""nana doesn't get her breathing compromised"". It's so cute to hear!Still, it's also a contribution to the environment. Fewer plastic containers (the washing soda means we use less detergent so it lasts longer and clothes still get clean), those polyester sheets (the dryer ones) don't end up who knows where, and the perfumes don't irritate anyone's skin nor end up in the water as pollution either. This is written May 2022.I'd run out just in time for a cold snap and needed to wash our last warm blankets. This seller had washing soda at the same price as my local market, even with free delivery! Couldn't ask for more. Everyone else was running errands and I could keep my family warm. Thanks!!",positive,washing powder

This stuff is amazing. I bought it to strip my comforters and it worked so well. Now I use it in every single load and it brightens everything. I’ll never wash without it again!,positive,washing powder
Product is GREAT!  Amazon packaging is not always great.  Sometimes it is in a plastic/vinyl envelope by itself and gets crushed in shipping.  Then the powder is all over the place in the packaging.,positive,washing powder

Makes the laundry smell fresh and clean and I assume it us helping our detergent work better since we are using less. Can no longer find this at the stores in our location so had to order from Amazon. It came within about 2 days.,positive,washing powder
Another staple in my laundry routine. Use mainly with towels. Helps give that added feel & smell of freshness. I had an appliance repairman tell me dryer sheets aren’t good for use on towels. So I find this is a good alternative.,positive,washing powder

"After trying a variety of less expensive laundry detergents and being disappointed with the results, I switched to Tide several years ago. With my top loading machine, I used liquid Tide, which is also handy for pre-treating stains. Now that I have a HE front loading machine which recommended the use of powdered detergent. Very few local stores carry boxes of regular Tide in powdered form, so I order it through Amazon. The detergent is affordable, reliable, and efficient.",positive,washing powder
"I especially like this particular product because:  first of all, it is Tide and Tide does a great job of cleaning the laundry. Secondly, the Tide is in powder form, not liquid, , so it is NOT packaged in a plastic container! Both reasons are equally important to me.",positive,washing powder
"I was very hesitant to switch from liquid detergent to powder, but my husband kept putting the challenge in front of me. He swore that our clothes would be cleaner and fluffier. He was CORRECT!!! The powder gets down into the fabric which cleanes better! I recommend powder to everyone I know. Yes liquid is more user friendly, but..you will spend WAY LESS. You will be hooked :) why are we so stuck on liquid ?",positive,washing powder
"I refuse to use these stupid ""pods.""  They are NOT a good value and the appliance people tell us that they mess-up and in some cases damage washing machines beyond repair.  MUCH better value and better cleaning than the pods as well.",positive,washing powder

I am a lifelong tied user however I had purchased liquid tide for the last 20 years. First I barked at the price but then I saw it was good for 102 washes so I took the plunge!After much research on cleaning different surfaces from tile to wood fencing I found that powdered tide is the most effective so I bought it and it’s true! You can use it on any surface you please as long as you mix it with the proper ingredients .,positive,washing powder

It’s actually the same price in the store but it is cheaper if you get the automatic send every so months so that’s what I do and it makes it worth it especially if your like me and have a big family and a busy life it’s nice for my phone to randomly tell me they got my back and is sending me laundry soap so I can wash my kids dirty clothes haha,positive,washing powder

Nothing particularly. Just good for such price,positive,washing powder
I used to try to save a little money and buy cheaper laundry detergent. It does not work in the long run to try that. It actually costed more money to use the cheaper detergent.The cheap detergent does not clean no where near as well as tide and I would have to use over double on everything just to get it clean and even then I would smell sweat or something. With this Tide PowderI can use two tablespoons full and it cleans and works great. The Enzymes they use is what really breaks down the dirt and sweat and odor. This box I can make last for 4 months or more with my H.E. washer machine.,positive,washing powder
good product,positive,washing powder
"Excelente producto, agradable olor , le saca todo el sucio a la ropa",positive,washing powder
"I have allergies to detergents, so I generally stay away from anything scented. I use cloth diapers though, which need something stronger to fully clean them, that won't harm the materials. I've found this Tide is a good balance of the two. I haven't broken out in rashes from using it for my baby. My baby's bum never has any rashes either. And the cloth diapers always seem good as new when they come out of the wash.And I mean, if this can clean human waste, I'm pretty sure it's made of magic and pixie dust. And could clean anything.",positive,washing powder
"Found on a TikTok I’ve had screenshotted for months about how to “detox” clothes. I ordered the ingredients to clean a thick Carhartt jacket my husband used to wear in the oilfield (thank you, pandemic). It smelled like oilfield dirt and oil and finally put this to the test.I used 1 whole cup of powder detergent, 1/4 cup of Borax & 1/4 cup of Baking Soda.Fill up tub with HOT water, pour and stir in ingredients and then put in whatever clothing you’d like to strip clean (doesn’t bleach or make color fade). I let this jacket sit for 5+ hours, stirring every hour. What’s crazy is this is AFTER I washed this jacket 4 times in a row! (Yes, I really wanted it clean). You can do this with towels, blankets, used clothes and works well to get cigarette smell out!You’re welcome. :)",positive,washing powder

"I grew up with my mom using this, then the world became advanced and got liquid, and then pods. I've been using pods for the last few years and relied on them heavily due to convenience of just throwing one in. After following a cleaning page, I ordered Tide powder for everyday household cleaning. Mixed with water and a tsp of bleach, there is NOTHING this formula can't tackle- it's simply amazing.I just started using it in my laundry, and man, my laundry smells so fresh and clean that I have minimized my use of pods because I just LOVE this stuff. A multipurpose cleaning product??? It doesn't get much better than that. Highly recommend!",positive,washing powder
"We use this for cleaning floors and our clothes after watching a certain cleaning influencer on Instagram. I’ll never go back to liquid detergent. As for the scent, I can’t speak to that.

I wish someone had told be about this product earlier.  I had to see and read about from a cleaning company based in Canada.  Buy it and use it to do your cleaning.  A little goes a long way.

"Great value, awesome scent, but when I tried to open it a lot of the detergent spilled out as if it was jostled during shipping.

"This is interesting detergent. When I first saw the packaging andbhow it was labeled with a touch of Downey, I wondered if it was a version of Tide from another country. It is made by P&G. But on further research, I learned it is more like Gain than Tide.It is very fine and looks like powder. I use powdered detergent and it is coarser than this. It is also very blue whereas the powder I uluse is white with some blue specks. I don't know fir sure but I suspect that means that it has a lot of bluing in it. Bluing in the detergent makes whites look whiter. You can actually buy bluing on its own to use on white clothing.The package says to use 1/4 C for normal soiled medium sized loads. In looking at the P&G website, they recommend 2T or 1/8 of a cup for an HE washer, so half as much. Using that, my load of towels came out clean. They did seem a little rougher than usual. We don't use fabric softener on towels but I do throw in 1/2C of baking soda. This helps to cut any body oils or soils and softens the towels without reducing the absorbancy. The roughness doesn't seem bad but I will rewash them to see if they are still rough.The scent is great. Overall, I am satisfied with this detergent. Although I am a Tide girl, I know that most of my family's clothes aren't that dirty. With orices now a days, this detergent could save me some money if I use it on normally soiled clothing.",positive,washing powder
"While I haven't used powdered laundry detergent for a long time this was easy to use. The load of wash that I added this too washed up just like it does with liquid with no undissolved powder left on the laundry. This detergent has a scent when you open the bag and handle it to add it to the wash but I did not notice the scent much after the load was washed and dried, which is ok as I don't like much scent in my laundry.The bag is a generous size and will many many loads of laundry.",positive,washing powder
"I'm not used to using powdered laundry detergent.  I've gotten accustomed to just using pods, but this has really changed my mind! For a large load, about a half laundry cup of Ariel, with a Touch of Downy Freshness gets the job done in my top loader.  Laundry comes out smelling clean and fresh, and I really can't ask for more.  I also have not had any issues with any sensitivity to the product either.  I will say though that this is a very large bag - with enough for allegedly 99 loads.  I wish this came in a container with an easier to open and close mechanism.  I strongly recommend opening the bag very carefully with a scissors and a chip-clip works well for me to keep the bag securely closed.  Really great value here and this smells better than the leading brands. I've never heard of Ariel, but I am a fan of Downy dryer sheets so I gave this a try and am not disappointed in the least!",positive,washing powder
"besides the scent, which is really love, the most important thing to me when using a powder is if it rinses clean and completely off.  I had powder detergent stick to my clothes, towels, sheets etc becuase it didn't rinse off in the washer so I was a bit sceptical about using powders again.  This rinses completely off, not a trace !  The scent is heavenly.  I just love it.  My husband has sensitive skin and he loves scented clothes but they do cause him to itch but so far, so good on this one.  I did sheets and 2 loads of towels and one load of just his white tee shirts and no complaints.  This is a very good value, the bag is large.  When I did my towels, they seemed extra soft.  I have 2 brands that i use all the time but I think I might add this one to my list.  Every thing about it was good.  by the way, the scent is not overwhelming either.  It's just a nice, fresh clean scent.",positive,washing powder
"We have been using liquid laundry detergent for many years, so I was interested in trying this powder product to see how it compared.  First, it smells SO nice, very much like lavender.  Most of the laundry loads I do are medium sized, so I used about 1/4 cup of the detergent.  After the first load was done in the wash, as I took the towels out to put them into the dryer I noticed the towel fabrics were softer than usual and that was a great thing.  All of the powder had dissolved and there were no powder granules remaining on any of the towels which is nice.  After drying the towels they came out super soft and had retained a bit of that wonderful lavender scent.  Then I did 2 more loads of laundry and had the same great results with everything being clean, soft, and smelling nice.  Great product and I recommend giving it a try.  I'm so glad I did!",positive,washing powder
I do A LOT of laundry and am wanting to find something that works well and it light on my wallet. This is a good option if you have standard laundry that isn’t too dirty. It smells very nice. I on the other hand wash a lot of pee and pooo soiled garments ( I run a home for disabled adults) so it doesn’t quiet do the job for those loads. But I do use it on my traditional loads!,positive,washing powder
"I first want to say I like the scent of this detergent. It is a large size and does a lot of loads. The powder is small so it dissolves fast in the water. It washes well and leaves a light scent on the clothes once they come out of the dryer. If I had one negative thing to say it would be that all of the writing is in Spanish, so if you know no Spanish whatsoever, you can't understand anything on the package. It would be better if they put English writing along with the Spanish on the pack. I would still recommend this product.",positive,washing powder
"This is a great price for a large number of loads.  Seems to work just as well as the liquid detergent that my wife likes to buy.  This is far more economical and depending on your machine, you might be able to use just half of the recommended amount.  Makes the laundry room smell great.",positive,washing powder
This stuff smells divine....,positive,washing powder
I absolutely love the scent of this detergent. It is amazing! I love how it made my clothes smell. I also think it worked really well to clean my clothes. This bag of detergent is a great value and I would definitely purchase it again.,positive,washing powder
I loved this powder detergent. It cleans really well and provides a great amount so you don’t have to worry for a while about running out. Smells good and gets the job done. Very pleased!,positive,washing powder

Great smell cleans the clothes well and the scent is fantastic. Recommend,positive,washing powder
The eco-friendly packaging will make this a winner. I can put this powered laundry soap into my own little reusable bucket and eliminate that big plastic jug. It dissolved well in cold water and left my lenins so clean and fresh smelling. In fact it scents my whole laundry room. You may want to be aware of this if scents bother you!,positive,washing powder
"I was bummed at the hassle of having to use warm water to dissolve this, which is what the instructions indicated. Instead, I figured I’d put it in the little tray for powder detergent in my washer to see what would happen, and it worked! If you have a washer that allows for powder detergent, it should probably work for you also. The water was room temperature, I didn’t have to use heat, and everything dissolved fine. Clothes smell fresh and clean! Much more eco-friendly than liquid detergents, with significantly less plastic packaging.",positive,washing powder
"I am consistently washing sweaty gym clothes and uniform items and I could not fully get the musky scent out. I tried vinegar, scented booster beads, fabric softener, no fabric softener, different water temps, gym clothing detergent, etc. While the scent would get better, it was never 100% gone.I used this once and immediately noticed an improvement. Used it a second time and the musky scent was finally out of my clothes.Finally! I was getting fed-up. This will be a new laundry staple.For reference, I usually use Tide/Gain or other similar brands for laundry detergent.",positive,washing powder
So there is 6 in our Family 3 teens and a 2.5 year old so stains and a ton a clothes is always there. Oxyclean is by far the best stain remover and it keeps your colors bright! We are on auto ship with this one for sure! 10/10 and it comes with the perfect size scoop to give you maximum results! If you looking for a stain remover while keeping your whites whiter and colors brighter this is it! 10/10,positive,washing powder
"OxiClean has always been great for stains, odor removal and love the smell. Unfortunately Amazon's packing of the product sucks, this is the second time out of a few times that I've ordered it and again no tape on lid or inside of a plastic bag as the majority of times, had a trail of white powder from the postal truck to my front door (I'm sure they love the cleanup as well) looked like a shipment of drugs showed up!! Amazon NEEDS to do a hell of allot better with packaging on these products!!!!",positive,washing powder
"I bought this after reading reviews, hoping it would work for getting my husband’s polyester work shirts fresh smelling. I wanted to try this more economical option before trying a pricey sport detergent made for activewear. After multiple wears and washes, his work shirts had a build up which left them smelling funky even after washing. We already use detergent with this ingredient in it, but adding extra of this product, washing in hot, and doing a soak has made a huge difference. He no longer complains about his clothes having a funky smell and has been very pleased!",positive,washing powder
When I got the product the lid had popped off and all of oxiclean was in the package and was coming out of the box...was able to save at least 3/4 of it.  Needs a better lid,positive,washing powder
I tried  the original version advertised by infomercial like commercials when this product came out several years ago. I wasn’t that impressed. My normal laundry booster was out of stock. After a bit of googling I decided to give it a fresh try.  This stuff gives your basic laundry detergent the ultimate “Glow Up”. Clothes smell amazing days after being out away in your closet or drawer. The scent is amazing. It’s a “sporty fresh clean” with a sprinkle of scent that is so familiar it feels like a warm hug. It’s a new laundry staple that I never knew I needed.,positive,washing powder
"What i disliked was how it was shipped! Those concerts should have been taped shut! One was 3/4 dumped into the box and bag and I'm sure some I'm the UPS truck. I wasn't happy to see this. Common sense is to tape over covers that are not sealed, which I'm kind of surprised that these didn't have a seal so that's questionable to.",positive,washing powder
"Its 100% accurate. I couldnt stand the wet moldy towel stank whenever husband toweled himself down. Even in the hottest wash the stank stayed. The odorbuster worked miracles in just 1 wash, towels came out odor free.",positive,washing powder
"Oxy Clean obliterates odors and slays stains. One scoop always works for us. This includes pet odors, boy odors, and all levels of food and dirt stains.",positive,washing powder
Product container was open in the shipping box. I was able to salvage most of the  powder from the shipping box back to its container.  Container had no seal (tape) on the lid and wasn't in a plastic bag.Great product when you can use it!,positive,washing powder
I use a scoop of Oxi Clean with all my washing.The only dislike I have is that when shipping not everyone packs with no spill tape around the lid. Last time I received there was some spillage.Product itself is great,positive,washing powder

I like the size and actually it works very well on my towels since I have dogs. Dog smell is hard to get out. This product is a good brand good size and well worth if your clothes smell like your pets. I as well cleaned my washing machine to make sure it wasn't just that. It was the dogs left over scent on towels. There are some soaps that do not get out that perfume smell or cologne smell or sweat smell and dog smell.....plus my sinuses hurt when it's to perfumie. This is mild enough for me.,positive,washing powder
Great stuff... smells wonderful and clean,positive,washing powder
This did a great job . Really protects the colors and gives the clothes a nice fresh scent (not overpowering).,positive,washing powder
My gym clothes were coming out of the wash still smelling and I was losing my mind wondering if my washing machine wasn't holding up. Turns out I'm stinkier than I realized and my gym clothes were not getting any help sitting in the hamper a day or 2. This product has worked great to remove the smell and I use it just for my gym clothes load. I was skeptical but what an easy fix!,positive,washing powder
"Finally! I’d taken time off from subscribe and save for over a year for this product but this is the cheapest place to get it - even cheaper than Wally World in my area. FINALLY they fixed the shipping!  Received two of these today and all sealed, no spills. They also included air packs. I had them arrive spilled in the past and it was a nightmare to clean up. I’m still seeing some reviews saying there are issues but as of 9/1/22 I had a great experience.Don’t let the negative shipping reviews keep you from buying this in general, though, wherever you may get it.If you have stinky people or pets, this product is REQUIRED. I am sensitive to scents, use Unscented everything but for whatever reason this one product does not bother me. In fact, it makes me swoon. It makes stinky dog beds, sports apparel, anything belonging to my children/teens smell SOOO GOOD. I use Seventh Generation detergent and this in my washing routine. It gets ALL the stuff clean and smelling good again. It motivates me to do laundry because it just smells that good (ok maybe a smidge too far but I really do look forward to the part when I put it in the machine).",positive,washing powder
This is a great product if you have athletes in your family that have sweaty dirty clothes. It handles the strong odors from my teenage football and basketball playing son. The price on Amazon beat Wal Mart price too.,positive,washing powder
"First time buying this product, like it very much.  It arrived in a plastic bag but cap came off container, therefore I had to pour powder back into container.  Otherwise I will buy again, I'll look for it at store but if they do not carry, I will give Amazon another chance to send in better condition.",positive,washing powder
The product itself works wonderful.  However the items seem to of busted open even though it was taped shut and put inside a plastic bag to prevent it from spilling if it did bust open the bang also apparently got a hole in it so needless to say part of the product emptied out of the bag and the cardboard and it’s on my rug.  The good part is when I vacuumed it up it made my house smell really nice.,positive,washing powder
"The product works. Will it get out every single stain, mark, line, marker dab? No, but it works reasonably well on most laundry issues.Now the problem is with the way this stuff gets shipped. It will usually arrive with some kind of tape across the lid to keep it fastened on. Unfortunately not always. This makes it a problem as other reviewers have posted pictures and videos of the mess inside the shipping box. That mess gets on the floor, counter tops, carpets, basically anywhere the box is placed.",positive,washing powder
very good,positive,washing powder
"I love this stuff for stinky clothes. If you work in any type of food service, you know how hard it is to get ""that smell"" out of your clothes. Detergent doesn't cut it. But this oxi clean actually works better than the regular one for that stink that just won't wash out. Works great on pet stuff too. I also have allergies to fabric softeners, and this stuff doesn't bother me at all. I just wish it came in a bigger container.",positive,washing powder
"My husband smokes and sweats a lot. So his work shirts smell terrible and I was trying all sorts of washing detergent, fabric softeners, dryer sheets and scent boosters in our LG ThinQ wash tower to try to get the smell out. But, with the HE and water saving with the wash machine nothing was working. So I tried the Oxi clean. Finally! It has tackled the smell. Definitely recommend to use on your stinky laundry!",positive,washing powder
This detergent does a great job of keeping clothes smelling fresh and fighting stains. I use a small amount with my regular detergent when I’m washing out active clothes that we sweat in.,positive,washing powder
"I have found so many uses for this aside from laundry.  Most recently, I put it in a squirt bottle and pretreated REALLY stained carpet before shampooing. The stain disappeared and the area smells terrific. I also like that the sturdy tub can be reused/repurposed once it's empty.",positive,washing powder

I use this every load of towels and blankets and dog beds I do. I never used to get away from the smell of dog on all my things. This stuff really works! You just put a scoop in and wash. It works with towels too! I swear by this stuff now. * disclaimer - use it before the scent sticks in. My old dog blankets still had to be thrown away because this didn’t take the smell away. But it helps prevent it before it gets stuck in your items,positive,washing powder

Microfiber shirts smell good again.  Wife does not plug her nose when I get home from the gym anymore.,positive,washing powder
"This really works!!  I had quite a few tshirts that only had a slight odor when I wore them for 15 mins or longer.  I tried everything including Lysol sanitizer *(which I LOVE because of its' scent and the softness it adds to the clothes, in addition to sanitizing them) but they still had a mild funk that appeared only after wearing.  This oxiclean fixed it!!  I put all the offensive shirts in one load and let it soak for a few hours(overnight with warm water for Florida in the summer). I was worried that the oxy might discolor (bleach) as this has happened in the past with colored items and oxi versatile, but this did not happen with this oxi version.  I did  dilute this first in HOT water in a gallon of water, then added it to a FULL load of laundry with EXTRA water, let it agitate for a few, then stopped to soak overnight. This does not cover up odors, it does actually eliminate them!! It does have a MILD scent, I was surprised that people were complaining about the obnoxious and overpowering odor of this...……..I had the opposite reaction.  I can't even smell this after the laundry is done or while it was in the machine soaking!!  Maybe I didn't use enough?  I must have used enough because I lost the funk smell!!  I just added to subscribe and save, this is a keeper along with the oxi white revive.  I will say that the Lysol laundry fixed MOST of the offensive items including the towels that got musty, but this oxy fixed the items that the Lysol could not.  I also tried SEVERAL other options before including smelly towel, smelly laundry, citric acid, vinegar, ammonia, dawn, sport washes, generic oxy powders, .......I do have a water softener and also a laundry ozonator.  Trust me when I say these shirts did not lose the funk after all of this that they were REALLY OFFENSIVE but ONLY after wearing them for 15 or so mins and only by me!!  This is the ONLY thing that fixed it.  I'm not sure if it matters, but all of the offensive clothing was 100% cotton.  I don't own any poly or poly ""sport"" blends.  I have a top load that uses lots of water, an agitator, my detergent is on auto dispense by weight of the load...I needed to be sure that I was not using too little or too much detergent to cause/contribute to the problem.  Honestly, I used charlies soap for a year or 2 and I do think that is why I had the problem to begin with. Sorry, Charlie!",positive,washing powder
This is my go-to for when I notice my laundry doesn't smell as fresh as it should. Throw a couple scoops in and let everything soak for a few hours. Then add in the detergent and finish the cycle. Stank=gone!,positive,washing powder
We have used oxi clean odor blaster on our athletic clothing for years.  It is as advertised it takes out stains and cleans even the most smelly clothing.,positive,washing powder
"This is the best I have ever found to remove unwanted odors from laundry.  Have used this for quite a while now and have found nothing else to compare.  HOWEVER, the shipping/packing/or container itself leaves alot to be desired.  Most recent shipment arrived with top taped and product all over the inside of the box.  They even tried using air pillow bags to cushion movement inside box.  May try another seller to see if they have figured out how to ship product.  (Have to brush and wash off all the product from my book packed inside the box with this powder.)",positive,washing powder
"After trying just about everything to get the sink out of my sweaty yard shirts or gym shirts, I have found that does the job.  I add a scope of this with every load with my normal non scented detergent and have had great success. Give it a try if your dealing with the same issues.",positive,washing powder
"So love this product just not the way it came today. The times I've had Oxiclean powder delivered I've never had this happen fortunately. That changed today though- there was powder all over.Bubble wrap was in the box (not pictured here). The lid is not warped or broken, was just not put on nor taped down properly. The container was bagged but the tape was not put on the lid all the way. So the powder found its way out of the two corners, out of the bag and onto everywhere. All over my other chemical cleaning supplies & products. It was a mess. Luckily no chemical reactions.I'm not returning it because it's a chemical hazard & an ultimate eco waste all around for such a little product. I mean return it & possibly have it spill more everywhere else? No thanks.I just would like those in control to rethink the protective packaging & tape placement. When this lid is properly sinched down it works & holds. This lid in particular was not broken. It just was not properly closed and taped down.Fortunately I was able to save some of the powder & get it in the washer right away, even straight from the box. Probably going to stop ordering online too until the protective packaging & tape changes.",positive,washing powder

"I read previous reviews saying their product arrived spilt all over. Since then, that issue was “fixed” by adding tape to the lid. However my product still arrived spilt all over. The lid was tapped down by one strip of tape but the lid somehow still came undone. Not sure how that’s possible because the lid stays on really well when snapped on correctly (I’ve accidentally dropped my container many times & never did the lid pop off). Fortunately, they also put the container in a tapped up plastic bag so most of the product that spilt out remained in the plastic bag with a little spilling out into the box & getting on the rest of my shipment.  I didn’t bother returning for a replacement because I needed to use it right away & since I can’t find this size for this price where I live, it wasn’t worth it to me.  I guess the product spilling is just the price you pay for buying it online.As for the actual product- it is a must for me when I do laundry. I add it to every load. Gets rid of stains really well & fights tough odors. Even keeps laundry smelling fresh long after being washed.  I’m obsessed with it & a little spilt product will not keep me from purchasing again.  I just hope in the future it arrives all intact.",positive,washing powder

"I grew up watching those classic late night infomercials with Billy May's shout-talking about OxyClean and being amazed at the transformation of everything he used it on. I sort of forgot all about it until recently when I seen people on TikTok using powdered Tide on everything to clean. I felt nostalgic for the old OxyClean commercials and bought a couple of tubs to use for my laundry and household cleaning.I cant even express how great this stuff smells and works. My boyfriend and I are both oilfield workers. We get filthy dirty, often covered in mud, grease, and other nasty things. I made a paste with it and scrubbed it into our work clothes and I was very surprised at how well it not only removed the stains, but the smell of oil too.Since everyone has been cleaning with Tide, I decided to use OxyClean instead. I used it to scrub down the walls in my apartment. Since this is shared company housing and many people have lived in this apartment before me, I can tell you that it hasn't had a fresh paint job in quite awhile. Handprints on the walls, scuff marks, and questionable discoloration are all gone after a quick scrub down of simple warm water and 1/4 cup of OxyClean. Billy May's would be proud, and my apartment looks brighter and cleaner because of his late night infomercials.",positive,washing powder

Lid is not as secure as I would like. It sort of just lays  on top of the container once opened and does not  close tightly.,positive,washing powder
"First off, the product comes in a large, hard plastic container. They wrap it in a plastic bag to catch any product that escapes during shipping, and some dusting does escape. This is normal.OxiClean works like a charm, and you only use a fraction of what you think you would need, just enough to cover the bottom of the scoop, really. I don't know WHY they give you such a giant scoop...for really bad stains and smells, I guess.The first way we use it is on my husband's dirty work clothes. He works in a factory. I wish I'd known about this when he was working maintenance and I was a newlywed. I was trying everything to get his work clothes clean. We add it with the Gain laundry soap we use at this time for his work clothes.We also use it for the sheets, because my husband has a special kind of night sweat. It's toxic and, over time, eats through sheets and mattress covers. I'm not sure what's in it, but I think it's from his smoking. We add it with the Method laundry soap we use for our regular laundry.Then, the third way we use it...ya know how sometimes ya get REALLY busy doing other things while the laundry is going and you forget there are clothes in the wash...for a couple of days? And you need to wash them over again, because they stink pretty badly? But that stink never quite washes out with one wash? Throw some OxiClean in with it and it will take out that stink with one wash. It's a life saver--well, a clothes saver, anyway.So those are the three ways we use OxiClean powder.",positive,washing powder

"A bag of winter clothes was donated to a non profit kids winter coat drive.  It was full of name brand winter wear (Carhart, Columbia etc.,) BUT…. not only was the bag of clothes filled with flaky material (appeared to be from the flaking of the lining of some snow pants or jacket not in the bag).  This bag of clothes had a bad odor to them.  I took them home and soaked them in this odor blasting Oxyclean  for 24 hours in the washing machine tub.  I then spun them out and washed with regular detergent.  They came out fresh and clean.  Was so happy to re-donate  these items back to the program, thus keeping them from the landfill and still able to keep some kiddos warm this winter.",positive,washing powder

"It works and I honestly can’t believe it. I’d give this 50 stars, if it were possible. I have a baseball cap, that I wore to the gym various times, that STANK. Like I mean, it smelled so bad that, If you lost it, you could track it like a bloodhound. You might’ve even been able to incapacitate a bloodhound with this hat. I tried so hard to get the stink out of it. I washed it once, in hot water, and it stank. When I opened the washer, even when it was still wet, you could smell it. I washed it, again, in hot water on heavy soil... and it stank. Then, I found this stuff. I read some good reviews, so I put it to the ultimate test. I washed my stinky hat with towels, that stank, and a gym shirt that, you guessed it, stank. One scoop of this Oxi Clean, along with my regular detergent, and guess what the hat smelled like after? NOTHING!! It smelled like nothing. My mind is blown. I can’t wait to wash all my gym clothes in this and walk in there smelling like nothing.",positive,washing powder
"OK so I work out 6 days a week.  I like to run and I sweat every morning during my run and workout afterwards.  After a few months, my clothes would have this pungent smell even after freshly washed.  I have just been replacing my clothes over time because of this...but I can't afford to buy new workout clothes every 3 months for the rest of my life!  I told myself there MUST be a solution to this, I can't be the only one dealing with this!  So I started my internet research, reading reviews, watching YouTube.  This had the highest reviews so I tried it.  O. M. G.  I soaked my foul, sweat-soaked, damp clothes over night in the bathtub in this... when I tell you there was *NO STINK* in the morning I was AMAZED... blown away!!  Proceeded to wash the clothes after soaking (did *not* even add any to the wash), dried in the dryer....still NO SMELL.The real test, though, was going running the next morning in the oxiclean clothes.  After my runs the smell is usually strong and unbearable (sorry to my poor fellow gymmers) but after my run in the oxiclean clothes... NOTHING. NOTHING!!  I smelled like nothing!!  OMG buy this stuff now!!  I'm telling you it *WORKS* and has saved me from having to re-buy another round of gym clothes!!Update 9/21/2020Still working out in the SAME gym clothes as a year ago! I do a deep cleaning of my gym clothes about once a month, where I soak overnight then wash the next day. Haven’t had smelly workout clothes since using this stuff.  I would have definitely replaced my clothes 2 or 3 times by now... It. Works. Period.",positive,washing powder

"I cannot say enough good about this oxyclean it's my favorite,  we had a leak in our basement and I thought we'd never get the musty smell out of our clothes and surprise this took it out .so yay!!!!",positive,washing powder
This works on old stains and whitens my whites when I soak I love the smell.Problem I received opened It lost the fragrance. Needed to tape both sides,positive,washing powder
"I have used this for absolutely everything under the sun... stuffed animals, shoes, bedding, old clothes coming out of storage. It helped us get through our puppy's potty training days, and has saved countless linens when our cat was peeing on them. I've tested it before and after with a UV light, and it truly gets the stains out.",positive,washing powder
I actually love the product. The packing not so much. Twice I received with product spilling out of the container into a plastic bag that somehow had a hole in it. I was not about to clean up the spillage when it should have been secured better. Canceled my subscription because of that.,positive,washing powder
"I love it. But order it a different day than other items. I don’t want chemicals packed with food, let alone spilling all over...",positive,washing powder
Works excellent!,positive,washing powder
"I love this oxi. I replaced my laundry detergent and I only use oxi with the Odor busters. My teenage football boys sweet a lot and never mind the foot odor, with this oxi it removes the nasty sweet and foot odor. The only complaint I have is Amazon and their packaging. One time I ordered and they had it taped closed all the other times it’s all over the inside of the box. Who knows how much fell out of the box. So frustrating. Just putting it in a plastic bag isn’t any better. Amazon do better. Now I go to the store to buy it.",positive,washing powder
"I use this Oxsee clean laundry powder detergent to wash all manner of clothing. My husband works outdoors and his clothes get very dirty and this gets them clean and fresh. I also use it on my own delicate clothing on a cold water wash as well as all my sons clothing and everything gets cleaned the same. Great product and excellent value, cheaper than buying it at the store.",positive,washing powder
Extra stinky loads come out fresher and BRIGHTER!,positive,washing powder
This product seems to be useful for my purposes and I think many pet/animal owners would agree.HOWEVER - Amazon does NOT always pack/cushion very well ~ Be Aware that packaging of product may be  cracked or broken in some way causing product to spill upon opening...,positive,washing powder
Recommend to anyone . Awesome stuff,positive,washing powder
Always works good in my laundry or in some weird instances the carpet cleaner to get stains out,positive,washing powder
I love this product but I will not order it from Amazon again. All they have to do is tape the box lid. What a mess it makes when they don't package it properly. I lose product I and have to sweep it up.,positive,washing powder
"Cloths are fresh, most stains come out. Product is easy to ise",positive,washing powder
"I love the product, but Amazon continually ships it in insufficient packing. This time it was so damaged the product flew all over my kitchen even as I was carefully removing it from the damaged package. I've dropped it from my S&S list and buyer beware.",positive,washing powder
This is a great product for anyone that has multiple cats and dogs,positive,washing powder
Life is better when your clothes smell nice and fresh. You also don’t have to worry about accidentally ruining your clothes by using a stain removing spray because this does all that stun-removing work for you!,positive,washing powder
"My last child is officially launched into the world.  I have spent the last 8 weeks cleaning out closets, dressers, and 22 years of dance costumes, pool towels, twin sheets, Halloween costumes, prom dresses, athletic gear and books collected in our home.  The baby was 3 when we moved in.I sorted and washed every item before boxing for consignment shop, book reseller, and Goodwill.  This miracle prewash got it all looking great - removed stains, sweat....everything but hair dye.  Those towels went to the garage as mechanic scraps.My husband had some favorite work shirts that were not getting clean - he sweats and drives a convertible frequently.  The sweat between the leather seat and his back had become melded and it was a one time prayer wash using this prewash, color grabber sheets, and warm water.  They all came clean and only one had to hit the scrap-bin because of a hole in the fabric.It will have a permanent place on my laundry room supplies shelf.",positive,washing powder
"I have used Oxiclean for years.  I love the odor blasters...I have a 17yr old son that have feet that smell like nothing that should come from a human.  It is fowl.  You are certain you should just throw them away.  His socks are so bad, I almost cannot put them in the washer myself...I will often have him do it.  I have used this Oxiclean and they come out clean and nice smelling!  I have gotten to where I just add it to every load because it boosts the cleaning power and leaves everything smelling clean.  My husband, unknowingly, spilled a glass of wine in a camp chair and sat in it with his white shorts.  He got up later and we all had a good laugh, but it would not come out in the wash.  He used them to work in the yard because he didn’t care about them.  About a year later, I put some of the Oxiclean in a bucket, filled it with warm water and put the shorts in it.  I let them soak for about a week (we were at our lake house and left forgetting they were in the bucket).  I put them in the wash and look like new!  Love this stuff!!!",positive,washing powder
"I found this product once or twice at Aldi's and loved it!  The smell is lovely and not overpowering.  I never found OxiClean Odor Blasters Stain & Odor Remover again locally and decided to order it from Amazon.  It arrived in great shape, all five pounds of it, ready for odor blasting goodness.  I use very little (maybe 1/8 cup) with each load of laundry and am delighted with the fresh-smelling results.  Since laundry is a fact of life, this small, pleasant addition to a relentless chore takes the whole experience up a notch.  Why not?",positive,washing powder
My clothes smell so great after using this stuff!!,positive,washing powder
"Wow!!! This is an amazing product! We have a 14 year old Yorkie that has become incontinent and has to wear doggy diapers.  We use the washable kind and eventually they acquired the nasty urine odor even after washing in vinegar and baking soda. I thought I was going to have to throw them out and order new ones. Then I discovered OxiClean odor blasters! I can not believe how well it works! It has completely wiped out any urine odor! In fact, the diapers smell absolutely fresh and clean. Even the yellowing stains are gone! I was seriously blown away by how great this product works. I highly recommend it for any laundry issues. I am so happy I took the chance and tried it. It is worth every penny! I will definitely never be without it again!",positive,washing powder
"I do love OxiClean & order it a lot. It does a great job in the laundry & the clothes smell so fresh but….it didn’t pass the easy to use factor this time. It was packaged in a plastic bag, but they didn’t tape the lid on this time (I know they’re supposed to) so the lid was off & powder was everywhere. What a mess for me to clean up. Disappointed this time.",positive,washing powder

"IMO, you need to really consider powder detergent especially if you have a high-efficiency washing machine.  I used the Ariel Original powder detergent (which is now my #1 go-to for everyday clothes) and had to try this OXI version, too. I have a HE Maytag top loader with the option of deep fill.  I used to use deep fill often, which uses more water and detergent per load.  I did this mostly because I couldn't get a good deep clean for my kid/dog/hubby clothes on the regular HE option.  No More!  This detergent gives me a perfect deep clean with the HE option!My laundry nemesis is sports clothing, especially my Athleta gear and my hubby's BJJ gi.  These are expensive products that can't take harsh detergents or bleach. I’ve used many different brands of detergents for these items. I tried just about every treatment and remedy to get sweat stains and smells out of the gi out with no change. Based on my great results with Original Ariel powder, I tried this Ariel with Ultra Oxi powder. Imagine my surprise when it took out the sweat stains and gym smells, without fading the trim or patches! No pretreat or additive was needed.  My Athleta gear also came out fresh and clean, with all the fabric's wicking properties intact (did not use fabric softener). Also took the consistent dinginess out of my white bath towels.  I used it to wash some smelly kids' shoes and dog towels--everything came out clean and fresh!Additionally, it's more environmentally friendly with less water in the manufacturing process and the thin plastic bag vs a plastic jog. I poured my bag of detergent into an old laundry pod detergent container, and it works great.  And, have you looked at the amount you need per load? You need only a little bit. You get a lot of loads in one small bag.Next big thing: it dissolves beautifully, even in cold water! Because our winter cold water is painfully cold, I do sometimes dissolve the powder in some hot water, but I'm not sure you need to do that. And the scent is quite fresh and clean and not overpowering. It rinses clean with no residue in the drum. Of course, it deep cleans and the clothes look great. Colored clothes are bright and whites are truly white, not dyed blue. It also appears to be gentle on clothes, with no pilling or fading. In fact, a lot of my clothes and towels looked better than ever after 1 wash.Let's talk price--I can't believe you can get such a high-quality detergent at such a fair price (at the time I wrote this the price per load was about 15 cents).So, I really think Ariel with Ultra Oxi is an excellent product, and if you haven’t tried it you definitely should!Hope you found this review helpful!",positive,washing powder
"This is a very large bag of powdered laundry detergent. It has a strong fragrance and is boosted with the Oxi components. Each load requires quite a bit of powder. Although the scent is very heavy when you’re pouring it into the wash drum, after the clothes are out and dried, it’s not nearly as strong. The detergent is from Mexico and I have never used this brand until now. Also, no scoop comes with the detergent. I’m currently using an old measuring cup with mine. Since it needs so much, I like to be sure my measurements are correct. Although it would seem appropriate to come with some sort of measuring scoop in the bag. Overall, I think the price is very reasonable for so much powdered laundry detergent with the Oxi boosters.",positive,washing powder
"This is good laundry detergent. I like that it contains Oxi, so it will help get out stains. I need to use powder detergent because I have a small washing machine and the little pods have too much in them for me. This has a nice scent, I would describe as fresh. It's not overpowering, but also you can smell it slightly on your washed clothes, which I like because they feel fresh. The bag is slightly thin, but I remedied that by putting the entire bag into a jumbo slider freezer bag and it fits with room to spare. If you're going to the laundromat you can scoop some into a smaller baggie to take with. This will be my new go-to laundry detergent.",positive,washing powder
"I’m surprisingly pleased with this laundry detergent. I’m a little finicky when it comes to laundry soap — and was a little skeptical ordering it off of Amazon. It has to work, not cause any irritation to my skin, and it has to smell good. This stuff delivers on all three! And a bonus that I can now order it and have it delivered right to my door!!My only recommendation is if you have a front loader washing machine, put it in the drum before anything else to avoid it getting trapped in the clothes and clumping up.",positive,washing powder
"The detergent has a nice fresh scent that is not overpowering. I have been using it in my front load washer by just tossing a 1/4 cup in with the clothes. All of the powder dissolves and there is no residue or dust left behind on the clothes. . After removing the clothes from drier there is still a fresh fragrance, but I repeat not over powering (I do not use any of the heavily fragrances cleaners on the market). I am not dealing with heavy soil or grass stained kids clothes. I think the price is great for a detergent I would use for everyday general laundry.",positive,washing powder
"This detergent is owned by the same company that produces Tide. I'm considering switching to this detergent as I like the cost, fragrance, and cleaning capabilities.",positive,washing powder
This detergent powder is definitely a great value. You get a huge bag of it for less than ten bucks. It smells nice and cleans well. I’ve done several loads with it and haven’t noticed any residue. My only issue is there were several small punctures in the bag so I’ve had to transfer it to a different container.,positive,washing powder
"Smells GREAT! Very clean fresh scent - I use this on heavier loads of laundry in lieu of my pods. It just works nicely for socks, undies, towels and sheets. I moved it into a different container however, because it just comes in a non-resealable bag, which does NOT work for storage and use. As long as you have something to transfer it to, its great!",positive,washing powder
I love this detergent!  It cleans well and smells fantastic.  I use the Oxy Ariel on my whites and regular on my colors.  It smells so good and fresh.,positive,washing powder
This stuff smells pretty good. It has enough of a smell to still make my clothes smell nice as they go into the dryer. It didn't seem to damage anything. The only problem I have is that it comes with no measuring cup. You have to provide your own.,positive,washing powder
Been using Ariel since I was a kid. And now with oxi added to it make it even better for me. Helps clean my clothes with less detergent.,positive,washing powder
It was wonderful to be able to test out and review Ariel laundry soap.  It's been used in my family for my entire life and we all love it.  Still works great.,positive,washing powder
"I like that this dissolved so well in luke warm water, yet delivered the grease cleaning action that was needed to clean dirty work clothes. I did not want to use hot water because the dark clothes fade more quickly in hot water. I like the packaging, no wasteful plastic jug. This soap worked well on a tough job.",positive,washing powder
