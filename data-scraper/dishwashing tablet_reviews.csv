"There is nothing quite as lovely as awakening to a dishwasher full of what appear to be clean dishes, only to discover that the Finish Tablet is still in the tablet dispenser, which is open and contains a revolting mess of half-melted product, pink center tablet intact.  I never have had this happen and didn't even think of putting on gloves to before removing the product, with a paper towel in my hand.  Man, do my hands sting!I did everything I've always done prior to washing my dishes.  I took the paper off the the tablet which was brokeb in half, put it into the dispenser and closed the dispenser. I then ran the hot water faucet next to to the washer until the water got as hot as it gets, then started the dishwasher on Normal Wash.  I always turn the Heat Dry button off because the water is so hot, my dishes are usually dry when I awaken.So, while our town is not quite out of the drought, water ran through a cleaning cycle, only to rinse the dishes.  None of them were actually clean. I had to run another cycle this morning.I ordered this type of Finish by mistake.  I've always had the best luck with the tabs that have a clear coating that disolves when the hot water hits it.  As a Conservastionist, I don't like the idea of adding more paper to our landfill.  I kept it because it seemed like a stupid thing to exchange but now I wonder.  The waste is amazing.  There have been empty papers in the container; the first tablet I took out to rrun the dishwasher this morning had to be thrown away because it was just powder.I'm also a frugal New Englander and don't appreciate feeling like I'm wasting my money and I certainly have wasted it on this purchase.  Shame on Finish and Shame on Amazon for selling a second-rate product!  I am very surprised and not at all happy.Unless I have to, I won't buy any dish tablets from Amazon in the future. I will attempt to return this product but to top it off, the box in which it came, was soaked because it was delivered on a rainy day, and I put it in an old container I had from the other type of tablets that I usually buy, that have no wrappers.  Hopefully, they'll take it!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Aside from not seeming to even clean my dishes, it left these strange dots on my dishes and actually made them DIRTY.Its as though the chalk in these packets was being burned into my dishware in drops. Its worse than having wax on them, they are like plastic. I thought my glass bowls, and plastic bowls had been warped at first.I CANT GET THEM OFF. They aren't just flat spots, they are raised bumps like hot plastic has been burned into my glassware and I HAVE TO GET NEW DISHWAREI used pods from WALMART for far cheaper before this, and they actually did their job WITHOUT damaging my dishware. I ordered these for convenience, and now I have to replace my dishes.So I encourage you to use ANYTHING else.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I never write reviews but after I bought a 96 count of this worthless dishwasher detergent, I felt compelled to help someone else avoid this disastrous Detergent. Even if I use 2 packets on a wash it comes out with a grunge film and is barely even clean. This is also using a jet dry rinse aid. Anyways life is too short to deal with a detergent that doesn't clean your dishes so I highly suggest you don't buy this product. I now have 54 more packets I need to get through but considering throwing them in the trash.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Updated. Called Finish and told them that every pod was just powder. It got a NEVER HEARD THAT IN MY 12 years here and that can‚Äôt happen. That then implies I broke 94 pods, because I sent them the video of all the pods PUFFED UP filled with air and the powder  residue all over the outside of the box and inside Amazon shipping box . Yes, the  representative issued coupons and I got them today hence why I waited to write the review however I did expect a check so that I could deposit it and then buy more dishwasher pods. Been with Finish for every but going forward it‚Äôs a different brand.Anyone know how I can post the video here with review ?This is my go to dishwasher pod. For sometime now they come in a cardboard box (which is fine) I happened to have saved and prefer the old style plastic tub because I can re seal it easier and it keeps out any moisture that could be under sink. So I set the stage..... I rotate old to new when i get a new box. I tip the old out on countertop and get ready to place the new ones in, the very first one is ‚ÄúALL  Powder ‚Äú nothing solid about it except the round ball (I can feel it), I grab another and another and so on. At least ten, back to back are broken into powder. Which when I think of it and look back it the other item with this order in the amazon box is covered in a ‚Äúdust‚Äù!of FINISH soap. This can‚Äôt be a shipping issue, the Finish box is 100 percent fine. I tried to call the Finish company but missed them by 15 minutes after hours.  I researched on line and many places said the the pod needs to be in whole form and not broken up, to work properly.  I‚Äôm baffled on this one , as I said the box is fine. Is this a manufacturering issue ? Anyone seen this happen before?",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Please do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks to get the more expensive brand. Do not make the mistake that I did by trying to save a few bucks, it‚Äôs simply not worth it. This detergent SUCKS. I hate it so much. It does not clean the dishes well and leaves a ton of water marks. I have to put my dishes in the dishwasher for multiple cycles because this detergent does not do it‚Äôs job.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"This doesn't wash clean or dry. My dishes came out with crumbs on them, if they were used for oatmeal, it would still be stuck on them. Water everywhere even after a full heavy wash and dry cycle. I've used the store kind before and they worked, thought this was a good deal. I went back to start I know even if it costs a little more. I'm back to clean and dry dishes.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"So at the time of purchase, I was getting things for around the house. Soap, laundry detergent, seasonings, you know. So I purchased this LARGE box of this product, and they are the absolute worse, it leaves powder, and this film, that won't dry ü§Æ. You actually have to spin the dishwasher 2-3 times, I have a water bill. From what I understand, this product is used in restaurants, which explains the hard water stains on dishes and utensils. Now I'm going to throw the entire kitchen away. Remember everyone, you get what you pay for.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Been using this product for some years off and on, and always found it reliable.  Unlike others, I DO like the fact that they are individually wrapped, because usually as I load the dishwasher, my hands are wet and when I (carefully) go and grab a dishwasher pod from a bucket of unwrapped pods, they inevitably get wet and stuck together.Now the bad... these pods don't clean that well and just don't completely dissolve and leave a white powdery residue on dishes and on the interior of my dishwasher.  I thought maybe I was loading the dishwasher wrong, or maybe something wrong with the dishwasher itself.

"Finish All-in-One has absolutely ruined my 2-year-old tableware. It was spotless before I bought this junk and now it's a blueish color and covered in terrible, unsightly water spots.

"I bought this product as result of Amazon choice recommendation.1. It is a powder in block form2, I have used two blocks in dishwasher to get dishes cleaned.3. Have had to rewash several loads of dishes  Dishes have been greasy after one wash.4. custard cup used for strawberry sauce has required 2 dishwashing cycles and my sink wash to remove all residue. hardened after heat cycle5.I have a new dishwasher and sometimes Finish block sits in opened soap chamber in the door never reaching the dishes.6.Pots and pans have to be completely washed and degreased prior to auto dishwashing.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Normally when you order these detergent pods online they arrive melted and fused together.  Good luck returning them.  But this is an entirely new twist.The soap arrived and each soap disk was individually wrapped like a chocolate.  Failure to disclose this is reason enough to want to return it.  However, they doubled down on bad.  The soap disks arrive, individually wrapped, and totally pulverized and broken.Good luck getting this garbage into your dishwasher to wash the garbage off your plates.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"This box contained many empty wrappers. A number of the other ones, had been opened and crushed. Disgusting! You expect me to wash my dishes with that. Won‚Äôt be buying these again!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I chose these because of all the rave and the good reviews and simply because of the brand having a good reputation. I used to use the generic dishwasher tablets and they never ever left a build up that I can‚Äôt even rub off with my fingers. Very disappointed in this. I‚Äôm never buying these again.Like literally, I used the last tablet of my generic brand and my dishes were perfectly clean‚Ä¶use these the following day and each day thereafter and disappointed each and every time.",negative,dishwashing tablet
we used to be very satisfied with this product - the last batch though must have been utterly misshandled during shipping/delivery ... every 3rd or so tablet is totally mused and crumbled up to pieces once it we try getting it out of the wrapper ! Unfortuntley we started to notice that a few days after the return window closed - what a shame  !,negative,dishwashing tablet
Be careful tearing open the foil packet!  Most of  the tablets have been smashed and crumbling.  My dishwasher still needs a rinse aid with product.  I ordered this product from Amazon because stores near me were out of stock without a restock date.  The quantity in the box at 94 will take me a year to deplete.  I do not store this under the sink.  I'm disappointed the product is smashed inside the foil packet.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Had to rinse a load of dishes 3 times after using a detergent pod.  There wasn‚Äôt just a film - there was caked-on detergent on dishes.  If I used a glass I‚Äôd be drinking a small amount of detergent.  I  have never had this issue with any other product.  I rinse my dishes fairly well before putting in the dishwasher and use the washer to sanitize and deep clean..  These pods are not good.  Caked on detergent has happened twice and I checked to be sure the water was hot and the dishwasher was heating. I tried Cascade and didn‚Äôt have this issue, so I have thrown out the pods.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These dishes have been ran through my dishwasher two separate times, and that was how they came out the third time. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs this particular style of , but I will never purchase any Finish products again",negative,dishwashing tablet
"94 of these little beauties and each one is individually wrapped! Not only are they incredibly inconvenient to use but WHEN are companies going to take responsibility for their wasteful packaging? I've gotten other Finish dishwashing ""pods"" and each one was individually encased in plastic. I was hoping this product would be better. I'm trying another brand next time.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I‚Äôve been using Cascade Platinum with no problems but decided to try this to save a few bucks. Big mistake!  Most times my dishes come out as if there is no detergent at all in the dishwasher.  I‚Äôm going back to Cascade Platinum.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Unless you want 98 little packages of soap, do not use. Each package must be opened indivaydually. The results are statically bags that stick your fingers.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I have used this product for years and really enjoy it, but this package didn‚Äôt work well for me. I usually buy it from the grocery store, but decided to stock up and bought on Amazon. The tablet doesn‚Äôt fully dissolve as sometimes. My dishwasher is getting older, so maybe that‚Äôs part of the problem. Sometimes it works, but about once every 10 washes or so, the tablet won‚Äôt dissolve. Maybe I got an old box or maybe it‚Äôs my dishwasher?",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These are hard as rocks and don't open in the dishwasher more often than not. Too late to send them back, but would not buy again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Most of the pods were out of their wrappers.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I use my dishwasher a lot. I go between the gel packs (which are nice and much less waste, but they can also stick and be messy) and then the good ol' fashioned hockey pucks like these guys. I ordered them last year and didn't have any issues. But this box that came in, I could tell something was off. Most of the pouches were smashed to pieces. Granted, you can say, ""well, you're still getting the product, just not in the shape that you were promised."" I didn't raise a stink about it at first because ""oh well, it all goes in the dishwasher anyway and as long as it works"" BUT IT'S MESSY. Not only is every little puck individually sealed (blessing or curse, your opinion) but once you open it, DISHWASHER FAIRY DUST just goes EVERYWHERE. Good thing this isn't made of glitter because I would still be cleaning it up. I don't know if it's the carrier to blame or the manufacturer. Perhaps they weren't stored in the right conditions or they were delivered with a thunderous THUD. I will be sticky to the Finish Gel Packs for the time being and I will take my risk on the sticky gel packs for now.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I had to rewash all my dishes with a cascade pod because this left little pieces that didn‚Äôt break down and also left a film on all the things in my machine.  I have never had a dishwasher cleaner do this.  I have used the liquid pods by Finish and they work great.  I would not recommend these.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Have used these on two different kinds of dishwashers and both had same results. Powder residue all over the dishwasher load.,negative,dishwashing tablet
These came in hard individually wrapped pods. Each pod you had to struggle to get the wrapper off and hope they didn‚Äôt crumble. No scent and didn‚Äôt clean that well. Amazon should be embarrassed.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"These are awful. I‚Äôve used before with no issue, but maybe this is a bad batch. They crumble as you unwrap them. They literally just fall apart in your hands and make a mess. I will not buy again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"At least half of the tablets I've used have been smashed into pieces or powdered entirely and some didn't even have the red ""powerball"" in the packet at all.They don't do a good, or even decent job of cleaning dishes. I always wipe down my dirty dishes in the sink before loading the washer and these still don't make a clean dish - no, they even leave a white residue behind on the dishes so once they're done washing, you have to wash them again (without detergent) to get them actually clean from being ""cleaned"" by these things.They're a total waste of time and money.

"I used to use these all the time from other places. When I started buying them from Amazon, I expected the same product, but it very clearly is not.

"I've tried this in two different dishwashers now, because I moved recently. I thought the dishwasher at my last place was the problem, because some of the dishes would come out with food residue still on them and all of the dishes would need to be at least re-rinsed if not washed again entirely. However, I just moved into a brand new apartment with all new everything including the dishwasher, and SAME THING. Some of my bowls came out with a waxy/oily film on parts of them and others, and most of the dishes needed to be rewashed.

"I canceled my subscription for this, even though it is the recommended brand for our dishwasher. The ones I had before had a gel wrapper that dissolved.

"I'm someone who pretty much just gives 5 star reviews but let me tell you about these bad boys.

Now I could rearrange my kitchen to avoid this problem but as it stands right now I have to open my under sink cabinet to pull one out close the cabinet open the dish washer and pour the powder out of the package and then close and run the dishwasher then reopen the cabinet to discard the wrapper.  If they were not all smashed I could open the cabinet omgrab and open the pod, hold the pod and throw out the wrapper, close the cabinet then open and place it into the dishwasher.

"We have used this brand for a few years now, but as we started using the tablets from this box, something seemed off. The tablet coloring has been more muted...some have been in pieces...while others have been just pure powder. But last night, when we saw this one pictured above, with some sort of black tape on it, it set off alarm bells....This is definitely not the same product we have been buying, and now we don't know what we have been using to wash our dishes. This thought was so disturbing, that we've thrown the rest away (had 3/4 of the box remaining). When we looked closer at the actual box, the colors are more muted (looks like knock-off packaging), and the seal at the bottom of the box, is not be consistent with US packaging standards. So buyer beware!",negative,dishwashing tablet

"Sadly it is getting harder and harder for me to shop on Amazon. So many counterfeit products or damaged products being sold as the real deal. These tabs have a different look to them once opened. Not smooth as usual, I‚Äôve been using these for 2-3 years mind you, but rough and bumpy almost like they have started to dissolve. They leave a sticky film on my dishes that turns to suds if handwashed after running through dishwasher. I thought this was crazy, so I came to check reviews. And sure enough, many other recent customers are having the same issue. I‚Äôll try to find time to call and report this to Amazon. I‚Äôm guessing these frauds make enough from people not bothering to return items. We currently have a box of Glad trash bags all made with the handles on one side instead of each side. We‚Äôve just been using them even though it‚Äôs frustrating. But I paid full price, not a defective product price. Ugh!

I was at the point that I wanted to replace the dishwasher and we were running out of detergent. This brand was sold out, and another name brand was all that was available so I bought that.Oh wow. The name brand, starts with a C, cleaned our dishes perfectly! After two loads of the other detergent, all the white film is gone and our dishes are shiny and clean.Will NOT recommend Finish brand detergent to anyone.

"I've purchased these tablets on three occasions since 2019.  Each time I looked for the least expensive per tablet cost under the belief that soap is soap and all the products are just marketing.  I've found that Cascade liquid washes better and is more cost effective.  Finish tablets, as documented in other comments, have come broken, powdered and aged and discolored.  The foil wrapper does not separate easily.  I prefer the tablets that come in soluble wrappers so you needn't open the packet at all.

I ran the empty dishwasher with hot water and white vinegar in a cup on the top rack. Then, I ran it again with baking soda. It was better, but not free of blue gunk.

Those worked fine and I don't see how this is any improvement. (For the consumer, it means you have something else to throw away.)

Unbeknownst to me, these dishwasher tabs are WRAPPED IN FOIL, that must be thrown into the trash and are not recyclable. Really?? In today's climate with landfills over capacity, should it not be good business practice to reduce waste, especially for a cleaning product, AND especially, that they already manufacturer a NON wrapped, completely dissolvable cleaning tab? I have written the company, but if you have any feelings about reducing waste, make sure you know what you are buying.

I don‚Äôt know if the red ball is supposed to disolve but it may as well be made of plastic Because it remains completely intact. All my silverware look like they have a rust-like film on them.

I've used this product for years and have always been happy with the results. This last box though... I ended up having to handwash the dishes on the bottom rack.

Tried two more half full loads of dishes neither of which came out clean.I don't know if this is a counterfeit version of the product or if the formula has changed but I'm pitching this box and trying another brand which will be purchased at a local store.*Update*  - I ran a load of dishes using a different brand which was purchased locally and the dishes came out sparkling clean.

Dishes aren't clean. I've tried everything to make this work. It never cleans my lip balm off the rim of the glasses. I spaced them far apart to be sure and it still left lip balm on the glass. I put the dishwasher on twice and still was not sparkling clean. I thought this would be better than cascade but I guess it is only good for the rinse and not cleaning. I bought this because cascade was out and this was a waste of money. I bought cascade again and my dishes are clean now. Smh.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I usually buy Cascade pods and i tried these on a whim and i can immediately tell the difference. They leave white residue, especially on my pots and pans. They are all individually wrapped which adds one more unnecessary step, (and waste) compared to the gel meltable cascade pods. Another time i opened the dishwasher and found that the pod got stuck in the dishwasher door enclosure and was partially used, the rest of the suds were stuck on the door. Very disappointed in these.",negative,dishwashing tablet
This product works terribly. Buy different pods.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"When I opened the shipping box there was some powder in the bottom. No biggie, I thought. Then I opened the box of tabs and they're all crushed I side their individual wrappers. Normally I would feel guilty about the extra packaging waste of them being individually wrapped but in this case its helpful because I can open the wrapper and pour it into the detergent cup in my dishwasher. They seem to work ok, its really frustrating how much of a mess they make though! After this box is finished, I'm going to go back to buying pods at my local grocery store.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"We ordered this product because the price was good and the product is name brand. This order was terrible however. The tabs had obvious water damage and they barely cleaned the dishes. Also, our dishwasher developed a terrible smell during the time we were using these tablets. Now that we've switched to a different type, the dishes are cleaner and the washer no longer smells. Spend a bit more for a better product.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Three out of four of the dishwashing pods were either broken or crushed inside their foil wrappers.  This appears to be ""seconds"" or over runs in the manufacturing process.  Obviously there was poor quality control when this package was being assembled.  The price was great but the quality and ease of use is not.",negative,dishwashing tablet
It doesn't clean the dishes they smell awful like rotten eggs I had to hand wash I'm asking Amszon for a refund,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Almost every pack I've opened the tablets were broken and/or crushed. I tried using them anyway, but all of my dishes came out with a white, powdery residue all over them. I also don't like how they are individually wrapped. When I'm loading the dishwasher, I rinse first so my hands are wet. It makes it hard to open them with wet hands. Very unhappy with this purchase. Will not buy them again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
The product leaves a powder film on dishes and all over the dishwasher. Won‚Äôt buy this product again.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"This is the worse dishwasher pod ever. I didnt think you could screw something up so bad. I will go back to the gel ones. Every single pack opened the pod is crushed into tiny pieces, its horrible. These appear to have been sitting on a shelf for years. I have never had a tablet dishwasher pod be in pieces like this. Going back to cascade. Will not purchase again. So disappointed :(",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Worst product that I ever had the misfortune to purchase!!! Left soapy film on dishes, tried to wash it off, that did not work so I had to hand wash all the dishes again! Like an idiot it tried the product 2 more times with the same result. Kind of makes having a dishwasher useless! I threw the product away and bought Cascade, problem solved!  I feel that Finish owes me about $15.00 for buying their miserable product. Apparently, no quality control at Reckitt Benckiser LLC. They ought to be ashamed!",negative,dishwashing tablet
most often some is left behind pick other brand,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I don't understand how this product got any good reviews.  It leaves a powdery scum, particularly on plastic ,  which is near impossible to scrub off.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Why?  Extra time to open and extra waste for every load of dishes.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"If I could give these ZERO stars I would. They do not work at all. My dishes come out with water stains, food stains, strange white coatings. Sometimes these pods don't even fully break down and you have a weird mooshy pile in the hatch. I have to run my dishwasher multiple times just for them to work. Absolute waste of money.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I‚Äôd you‚Äôre looking for things fast dissolving‚Ä¶this isn‚Äôt it.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Terrible product. None of the dishes are getting cleaned even after putting 2 in the dishwasher. I don't know if we received old product. Some of the time, I can see tab in the dishwasher not getting dissolved. Never buying finish products ever again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Used about half of the box and now finding packages with no tabs inside or with only part of a tab or no power wash ball. Packages are sealed, just nothing inside. This will be the last time I buy Finish premium brand. I wonder how many more I will find empty packages as I go through the rest",negative,dishwashing tablet

"I was using dishwasher detergent packets from Grove prior to purchasing this product and thought I would try this out as it was a good price on Amazon. This is literally THE WORST dishwasher detergent I have ever used! I would be better off not using anything than using these Finish brand tabs. It leaves a nasty, grimy film on all of my dishes and I‚Äôve had to rewash every glass and dish a second time after running through the dishwasher with these tabs. I am going back to using Grove generic brand dishwasher packets.",negative,dishwashing tablet

I would say half of the tabs literally crumble when you open them5. They ""clean"" but a few dishes, they had residue.6. BUY ANOTHER AND GENERIC BRAND!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These are a fine deal, but each use being individually wrapped is annoying.  Too many options out there to buy these again",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I don‚Äôt like these! They make doing the dishes cumbersome. I don‚Äôt like that, unlike pods, these are individually wrapped. And when opened the soap block is usually crumbled in pieces making it difficult to place into the little soap compartment on the dishwasher door. I didn‚Äôt notice any better cleaning results over the pods I usually buy. I won‚Äôt buy these again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Sadly, these tabs didn't work out and we put off the return until we went way beyond the return window. So, better try these ASAP and see if they work for you. They were crumbly and/or left a white powdery residue all over our dishes.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I don't know why but this product does not fully dissolve in my dishwasher (Kitchenaid, $$$). It leaves white sludge in the bottom filters and the dishwasher doesn't drain. I've had to run a gallon of vinegar through the system, and it's still not clean.Very disappointed.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"We have been using these same dishwasher tabs (storebought) for over a year and never had a problem. Since we ordered them online we have had to run our dishwasher twice or rewash many of our dishes. Often, the tab is released into the washer but never disintegrates with the hot water and large clumps of it are left on the floor of then dishwasher and our dishes are all covered with grains of undissolved tabs. I‚Äôm not sure if they are old or a bad batch, but we can‚Äôt even use the remainder of this order. I plan to contact the seller and will update with their response.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These were old, wrapped in foil. Once you get them unwrapped, the red power ball isn't attached and many of the tablets were broken or disintegrated.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I needed to add jet-dry to the dishwasher to stop films from forming. the other pods out there dont require the jet-dry.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Doesn't clean my dishes. I end up having to handwash my dishes because it doesn't clean them. The dishes that don't end up with food still stuck to them after I run it are covered in white residue. I switched to a different brand and have no issues.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"These pods work well and clean my dishes for the lowest price, however, after running a few wash cycles with this brand, I noticed that my throat was always dry and sore. They must contain an ingredient that can irritate your airways and if you are around the kitchen, the fumes created during the heat-drying process can make your nose and throat feel sore for a while. Ventilating the area seems to solve the problem but I'm definitely changing to a brand with safer ingredients.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Like other reviews have said, maybe bad batches lately? Because I am also left with a residue on all my dishes when I‚Äôve used these. Used another brand and my dishes looked great. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Dislike Opening up a foil packets that individual pieces are put in,negative,dishwashing tablet
"This product leaves a white residue all over plastic and glass dishes.  It really is terrible.  I have used other detergent, and have had success, so it is not the fault of the dishwasher.However, now that I have opened the box and used ~3 of the individually-wrapped packets, I can't return the box.  Now I am stuck with 90 absolutely useless dishwasher detergent packets that have the ability to make clean dishes dirty.  Please do yourself a favor and refrain from buying these detergent pods.",negative,dishwashing tablet
This is how I have received the product.More than 15% of the tablets are damaged.The product box has been violated and then missealed with duke tapeI cannot return them since I am abroad and it would be more expensive to return them ... than what they cost.I feel cheated.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Like others have stated, the product purchased here was largely broken up and left a white chalky film all over my dishes so that they had to be rewashed by hand. I think I got a bad or possibly even counterfeit batch because I have used this product for years without any problems. In fact, I bought a bag from the grocery store to replace the ones from this purchase and they worked just fine.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Before we tried these, we were using the Cascade pods and we might have one item every week or two that had to go back through because there was still food on it. With these tablets, we have 1 or 2 items per load that has to go back through. They just don't clean as well as the Cascade.",negative,dishwashing tablet
My dishes were very cloudy so I tried adding more Rinse agent to see if that was the problem and no store dirty and cloudy so I switched back to Cascade and everything‚Äôs fine again very clean very bright,negative,dishwashing tablet
"We typically use Finish products with no issue, but these pods are pretty disappointing. Basically every other item taken out of the dishwasher is covered in spots and speckles of residue. This is not an instance of overloading the machine or anything either. Even tried a longer wash cycle to see if it made any difference‚Äîit didn‚Äôt. It was tough to photograph but you can see the spotted surface on the glass i pulled from the dishwasher. Bummed we are stuck with an entire box of these :/",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I‚Äôve used Finish many times in the past and had no issues. Thought adding it to subscribe and save would be a good thing. Sadly, at least three quarters of the packets I‚Äôve used are either in pieces or crushed. I‚Äôm taking it off auto delivery and will buy it at the grocery store, never had this issue then.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I ordered this box---love the product but hate how they all got crushed!EVERY SINGLE POD, when opened, is in crumbles.  I take that back.  Out of 80 that I have opened probably 5 were as they should have been!AWFUL!  Love the product but hate how it was handled.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"IComplete waste of money. My dishes looked dirty every time. How is this detergent? As soon as I bought my regular Cascade, the dishes sparkle again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Tried this to save money over Finish Quantum gel packs in our Bosch. With Quantum, you just brush off the big bits and the detergent does the rest  But with Powerball, we soon found ourselves forced to scrub flatware. Also, we needed a rinse-aid to get rid of spots from our alkaline water supply.I'm going back to Quantum.",negative,dishwashing tablet
They do not do a great job of cleaning my dishes. They are also difficult to open in the packaging since they are individually wrapped.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"They clean the dishes fine, but 96 tabs individually wrapped is really a terrible way to sell this product. So much plastic!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I mean, they still clean the dishes. But these hard tablets need to be in a big plastic container. In a box, they get beat to hell and turn to dust. Quite annoying, sometimes I open up a packet and the red dot is the only thing in one piece.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Horrible,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I was excited to purchase these as I have used other Finish products in the past, but I was very disappointed in the overall performance.  Much of the pod would not dissolve and it would cake onto the sides of plates and other dishes. It also left water marks on all of our glasses, so we had to return the product and get a refund.  I would not recommend this item. Great seller though, as the refund was in my account 24 hours after the item was shipped back.",negative,dishwashing tablet
My dishes come out of the dishwasher as if I never ran it! Food stains still there and the powder sticks to the dishes also so they are actually dirtier after I wash them with Finish! I normally use a cheap Target liquid and it does a much better job then expensive Finish! Sorry I bought such a big box! Throwing out the other 89 pieces.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Finish works great but when this MegaPack arrived it had been rewrapped and the box was damaged. We needed to use the contents and all I can say is that virtually every tab has been broken in pieces and sometimes crushed to powder. Avoid this seller!!,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I thought these would easy (you just pop them in your dishwasher) and they are definitely affordable, HOWEVER, these left a nasty, powdery, soapy film on all of our dishes that does NOT COME OFF, even after re-washing by hand with regular dish soap.

Our dishes looked dirtier after being washed than before they were washed, and I would 100% recommend to just put your money towards a more high-quality dishwashing soap.",negative,dishwashing tablet

I don‚Äôt recommend these. All my dishes look dirty after using this product.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Irritatingly individually wrapped hard pods.  Didn't even fully dissolve when washed. Had to wash dishes twice to remove the detergent from all the dishes.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I bought this product because the item description and details said the cleaning pods were in a self-dissolving package, but once again the description is a lie.  These are wrapped in foil packaging and this is the second time I've ordered different Finish cleaning pods from Amazon and neither one of them were packaged as described.  I'm done with ordering Finish from Amazon.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"The box of dishwasher tablets was mailed to me in a plain yellow oversized envelope--meaning no padding.  Every tablet that I have opened to use thus far has been broken.  Which means all the soap gets on my hands and is messy to use, which is one of the reasons I went with tablets in the first place NO MESS.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I always rinse my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher and I am careful not to overload.  This product actually makes life more difficult.  Because it doesn't remove all of the dirt, what is left is baked on by the dishwasher drying cycle.  I tried using it without the drying cycle but the result is the same....caked on food on all of my dishes, glasses and silverware.  If I could give it zero stars I would.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I am very disappointed with this product. I have been using Cascade Platinum plus om short cycle for dishs and glassware with normal soul with great success. This product does not clean coffee stains form the cups of get the glassware clean . I will stop using it and do not recommend this product.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I purchased these several times in the past without any issues. They were always a good  value for the money. This box, however, not so much.

"Thought I would give these a try,They do not dissolve all the way,and for the first time ever my dishes are not coming clean.I threw the product in the trash, will not be buying again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Don‚Äôt dissolve. Dishes are often still dirty. I‚Äôve used Finish in the past and I don‚Äôt know what changed but I‚Äôm tossing 90 packets because 6 were enough frustration for me. Not to mention the foil wrap? Like do we not care about the environment any longer?,negative,dishwashing tablet

I bought this only because my usual dishwasher pods were out of stock. Never again. Most of the pods were broken and spewed dust everywhere. The fact they are sealed in a bag you have to open made dealing with dust worse. Going back to regular Cascade.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"This product falls apart when you remove the foil, like it is old. Even though the price seems very good it is not a quality product",negative,dishwashing tablet
I was disappointed in this detergent. Spotty dishes and poor cleaning compared to the ones with liquid packs.,negative,dishwashing tablet
So many of the individual tabs inside the box are smashed or broken. I usually buy gel packs and I will go back to that after these are gone. Plus having to open up each tablet is difficult with wet hands.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I didn't like the way they packed each of detergent tablets. All packs are individually packed in plastic which in not needed and it's not environment friendly. They can pack all the tablets in one bick plastic pack also.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"The packaged dishwasher pods are rock hard--so much so that when my dishwasher runs they do not dissolve.  They just remain a wet clump at the bottom of my dishwasher.  These pods are clearly extremely old.  I have used this product for years, but have not been able to find it in my grocery store lately so I ordered these online.  A waste of money!!",negative,dishwashing tablet
I‚Äôm trying to send this back to Amazon but they won‚Äôt let me return this item.This item just does not work to get my dishes clean and leaves residue andwater spots behind. Also they‚Äôre individually wrapped which I think is total nonsense and will be buying your pods instead in the future,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I foolishly bought a 94 count of these dishwasher pods without trying them based on the positive reviews here. However, I have used these twice and both times my dishes were not clean at all and there was a residue left on them. Because of this I had to rerun my dishwasher both times with different pods. It's possible that I got a ""bad batch"" but I won't be wasting my money on these again to find out.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"We ordered these to go with our new dishwasher because it recommends this brand and the samples we received seemed to work better than the kind we were using. When we opened the box to start using them though, many of the packets were opened and the tabs damaged and broken along with many packets that were completely empty. The price is good for how many you receive, but were pretty disappointed to find so many of them destroyed.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Like others are saying, these left a disgusting white film on everything in the dishwasher. Dishes had to be hand washed coming out of the dishwasher. No joke. Thought maybe something was wrong with my dishwasher, but switched to a different brand and everything comes out clean. Now don't know what to do with the 2/3rds box I have left. Do yourself a favor and hard pass on these.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Getting dishes clean in a dishwasher is a hit or miss proposition, but with these little lumps of concrete, it will never happen. We have had to run the machine through 2 or 3 cycles and the dishes still aren't clean. Most of the time the detergent is impervious to dissolving. The foil package is hard to open, it DOESN'T DISSOLVE AND CLEAN DISHES. I can't think of anything they are good at. I'm throwing away a box of at least 80 because I can't return them.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Would not recommend. These pods never actually dissolve in the dishwasher. They crumble and end up at the bottom of the dishwasher with half washed dishes. Thought it may be our dishwasher so tried them on a friend's dishwasher with the same result.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I bought the box of 94 tablets. I have done about 10 loads of dishes in my dishwasher and I am completely dissatisfied with this product. If it were not past the return window time I would absolutely request a return from Amazon. My dishes come out dirty and there is a film left behind that is difficult to remove even with a hot water rinse. I have to wash the load a second time with a different type of dishwashing detergent to get them to feel clean.,negative,dishwashing tablet
The product itself is fine.  Just don't buy it here.  The majority of tablets are crushed.  The box is flimsy cardboard and offers no protection during shipping.  I gave them a couple of tries and the results were the same so it's not a one time thing.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"This is one of the worst packages I have received by far!!! Shipped in a bag, product box was opened during shipment, several pods are unusable, and it was leaking powder when I picked up the package. I am SOOOO disappointed!!! We are running too low to return but I will not be ordering these again!!!",negative,dishwashing tablet

"The box and a lot of the pods were smashed making them unusable. I looked for a refund or a replacement, but I‚Äôm not about to return half a box of smashed dishwasher pods.

"The ACTUAL product is great, ive used them for a long time.My order came to my door and the individually wrapped tablets were all opened up and broken up floating around the box.Literally empty wrappers and broken up powerball tablets, and dustThe box was sealed up, never been opened.So how does this happen?????Seems to me somebody in manufacturing or the supply chain doesnt give a hoot",negative,dishwashing tablet
"The 1st tablet opened for use, fell apart.  Box was damaged.  Product came in original packaging, not an Amazon box.  The price for purchase was better than at my local store.  But if all thw tabs fall apart , I have not saved money.Each category should have only half a star.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"purchases this as i needed to use my dishwasher for a few weeks and saw that, when opened, the tablets sometimes broke. where a  very old white powder look over blue.  I dont see an expiration date on them so i don't know if that is the case but all in all this looks to be a rather old product that doesnt suffice",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Box detergent is cheaper and easier to use.10 times better that what?  Not washing?  Paper plates?  Eating off floor?  Overrated and over priced.  It does everything ""All in 1""  (sarcasm) but you still need to buy spot dry.....hhhmmm???",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I decided to try these based on some other reviews - they were a bit cheaper than what I traditionally used. Well, I see why. All the tabs are broken - may as well use the boxed powder for even less $. Not only that, they leave my dishes really greasy. I guess I was spoiled using tabs with Dawn in them. I will ne spending the extra and going back to them without finishing these.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I bought during the pandemic shortage as I didn‚Äôt have a choice... it was the worst dishwasher product I ever had...

"These suck.They're not much cheaper than better brands. It's chalky weird tablet that gets on your hands and sometimes breaks as you open it.

Worst of all, they don't clean well....usually I need two per load.Terrible, save your money and buy some other product.",negative,dishwashing tablet

"Misleading description, as it doesn't show the old style (frustrating) wrapping: difficult to unwrap, you'll end up touching the actual chemicals of each pod, dozens of times.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"So as a dishwasher detergent, I don't really have any major issues. It seemed to clean our dishes just fine, thus the 2 star rating instead of 1 star. However, I will not be buying this again. Each individual cleaning ""pod"" was wrapped separately. Not only is it time consuming but also extremely wasteful. Also several were crumbled, to the point that they were unusable.",negative,dishwashing tablet

"The tablets are all individually wrapped, which is by itself annoying since my hands are always wet from rinsing off dishes making the packaging tough to get open.

"Total pain in the ass. Each cube is individually wrapped, a total waste. I wish we could find the gel version instead of these hard ones. Cleans ok in our dishwasher, but each tablet being in foil is a major bummer. Can‚Äôt wait to be done with this box and move on.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"All of the tablets are individual packets which are plastic/ mylar and shipped in a cardboard box.  Each tablet was stuck to this plastic wrapping most likely from temperature issues during transportation (think melted candy bar). In my opinion this product is a waste of materials and a mess. The large tub of Finish ""powerball"" tabs that you can just put one straight in the dishwasher (no wrapper) is definitely preferred!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Upon opening, the product looked strange - like not very fresh and after using in dishwasher it leaves a white film on components and plastic dishes especially.

Who knows",negative,dishwashing tablet
This is the last time I will buy this product. Trying to save money I purchased this product thinking I can deal with the foil wrappers. The foul wrappers aren‚Äôt for presentation it is because they fall apart so easily. I wasted 4 pods this morning trying to start my dishwasher this morning. Each pods I grabbed was already in power form and had to be thrown away. Waste of our family money.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I didn‚Äôt keep it. Moreover I just threw it away cause it was bad quality product. First it did not help to remove  stains on my clothes. Next, it had bad scent. Therefore I cannot recommend it",negative,dishwashing tablet
They arent worth the money at all. This was 2nd time getting these thinking the first box was accidentally crushed. They are so many of the packs crushed . So i don't think its doing its job well. Dishes always have food still on them,negative,dishwashing tablet
This is terrible. I don‚Äôt know how in the world this got high reviews. This product does not clean well and certainly does not clean plates that have buildup. My Costco dishwasher pods were way better than this brand. This was used with rinse aid. Very disappointed in this brand and now need to purchase an entire order from another brand to avoid having to wash twice.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Don't even think about buying this product! First of all, almost all pods were crashed.

"This used to be a great product, but now most tabs are broken and powdery when I open them. They still work but if I wanted soap powder, I would have purchased the powder, not the tabs.

SO WASTEFUL. Do not buy! Every single one is wrapped individually in plastic.  I would have never purchased if I had realized that ahead of time. Also many of them are broken and crumbly when you open. I've had a problem with them not fully disintegrating in the dishwasher as well. Overall not good quality or packaging and definitely would never purchase again.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"First off, I have no idea why they are individually wrapped. What a pain it is to try to open one with greasy hands when doing the dishes. Secondarily, it leaves residue and soap particles on everything. (We have a newer bosch and we've never had issues like this with even kirkland pacs.)",negative,dishwashing tablet
If your are looking for the pods that are wrapped in clear film that you don‚Äôt remove these are not it. These pods are in a silver wrapping that you must take off. I‚Äôve thrown over half away bc they come out broken. They also do not dissolve well in my dishwasher. Bought by mistake and thought they would be okay but definitely not.,negative,dishwashing tablet
This was such a waste of everything! Tried it from a fully loaded washer to all empty except for one plate. These cannot clean a thing!! Cascade is 10000x better than this. Such a massive wasteful packaging too. There is absolutely nothing about this that makes it worth getting.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Does not clean better than bargain stuff. Save your money. I normally use Cascade. This is no where close to that. Big disappointment.,negative,dishwashing tablet

I just started using the tabs from this box.  I have found one that hasn't been crushed of the red ball fallen out of the tab itself.  The box I had before this looked as tho the tabs had all been doused in water .  All have bee useable but not the condition I want to see these in,negative,dishwashing tablet
It only washed some of my dishes and there were always spots on my silverware. I switched back to the more expensive stuff. I was trying to finish the box but I couldn‚Äôt. Oh and some of the soap was falling apart as I opened the package as if they were already wet.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Right out of the box I wasn‚Äôt thrilled with the extra packaging (having to unwrap the tablet EVERY time). The value is awful since I have to wash the same load of dishes or prewash or less dishes before starting the cycle. Even the glasses were gross after washing twice; I ended up hand washing them. A HUGE disappointment. Going back to Cascade!!,negative,dishwashing tablet
"If you like to hand wash all of your dishes after they‚Äôve gone through the dishwasher, this is the product for you! Left hard to remove soap residue on almost everything in the dishwasher. Total waste of money.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"This has got to be a joke.For 1 the product is NOT a pod!The product is individually wrapped packets of POWDER, which go all over the place.2nd of all, I ran a light load - guess what there is caked on food still on the plates.Total JUNK!  Don't waste your $$",negative,dishwashing tablet
Love these tabs.  Ordering from Amazon I thought they would be the same..they are save the fact they look pulverized.  Every single tab has been crushed.  HOW they did this I have no idea but clearly someone played football with this box.  Product still works but it's a damn pain loading the dishwasher with the dust.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"On opening the first foil packet, I found a powdery mess that went all over the place.  What a disaster!  I hoped for better luck with other packets.  Did not happen.  I am still looking for an in tact tablet. I should have returned the remainder of the box.I suffer.  Will not re order",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These pods are terrible. They are just pressed detergent powder that never dissolves and gets all over dishes. Half the pod is undissolved at the end of almost every cycle. The individual wrappers for every pod is extremely wasteful as well and difficult to open. Trust me, don't buy these. You will regret it and be stuck with them for months.",negative,dishwashing tablet
All of the tabs arrived broken. The are all individually wrapped so it was so hard to use them. Waste of money.,negative,dishwashing tablet

These are THE worst dishwasher tabs ever. They leave residue and grit on everything. Maybe it‚Äôs my machine but for me the liquid pods work 10000x better. Half the dishes are still dirty when I use these ones. Not good.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I had the same experience as many others. Many tabs came broken apart or in powder and when used it left white dots on my dishware. This was my first bad experience with this brand.,negative,dishwashing tablet
box was wet and soggy and individual pods were faded and in very poor condition. i should get money back for getting a package in such a nasty condition that it had to be taped together. i am very disappointed that a prime customer gets this low level of service. smh had to wash my hands thoroughly after touching it.,negative,dishwashing tablet

"I didn't realize I wasn't ordering the ""wrapper less"" version and now have to open each table individually.  This is both tedious and seems wasteful from an environmental perspective.  Why do they need to be individually wrapped when they are already in a big box.  Mysterious.  The scent is strong and could be toned down.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I ordered these because at the time of order they were slightly cheaper than A3zn's house-brand (Solimo) and they are ""manufacturer recommended"" by Bosch. They are individually plasti-foil wrapped tablets/pills/cakes. They do not have to be stored in an airtight container like pods do. They seem to have a smaller volume than some pouch/pod options. They have 3 different pretty colors of ""cleaning stuff"" so maybe red and blue and white clean better than just white does. They do seem to dissolve fully and leave no residue. I have 3 complaints.1) I do not think that they work as well to dissolve food as other brands, I have had to do a couple of double washes.2) Do you possibly have wet hands after loading your dishwasher?  I do. Opening the individually-wrapped cakes is not easy with wet hands.3) The scent after washing. The cakes smell okay when just unwrapped, but the post-washing scent of the dishes and dishwasher itself is almost unpleasant. It is just a step above a dirty-food smell.So they are just barely sufficient. I'm not quite ready to discard them because to do so seems like a waste of chemicals. I'll go with a different product when these are used up.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I thought these were the liquid pods sold at the store. They are not.These are little powder bricks and they work about half as well as the liquid ones. I have to add 2 bricks if I want the load clean, but regardless of how many I add to the dishwasher, sometimes there is a powder residue left on my dishes.I won't buy these again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Ok I hate that I have to unwrap each tiny thing of soap every single day. Wash fine just like all the others. Can‚Äôt wait till I use these up so I can get a more convenient packaging,negative,dishwashing tablet
When you put the tablet in the dishwasher the tablet is so hard that it doesn't dissolve properly and so the overall result of the dishwashing is not that great. The only fix I found was to pour hot water on the tablet before use to liquify it before use. But I don't think I should have to do this. Overall not a very satisfying product,negative,dishwashing tablet
2 packages of FINISH dishwashing detergent were packed in an Amazon carton.  The carton arrived in good shape but both packages were damaged.  I have no problem with the product which I have used for several years - but the packaging was poor.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I was on the hunt for a new dishwashing tablet and I had a tough time deciding between this brand and another well known brand. I went with Finish based upon the positive reviews and because, well, I figured a brand that's been around this long ought to get the job done. Turns out I should have just stuck with the house brand dishwashing tablets that I had been using. The Finish tabs are ineffective; they leave a film and they do not clean thoroughly. I really regret trying this out and I will not be using this brand in the future. I should have just appreciated what I had been using before! Oh well, you live and learn.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Great price and should be super convenient to use however 30-40% of the individually wrapped tablets were smashed in their wrapping which made them a pain to use.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I‚Äôm shocked this has such good reviews‚Ä¶.works probably half as well as other brands at similar prices. Awful,negative,dishwashing tablet
They seem to work but every single one is crumbled which makes a mess and is annoying. The one pictured isn‚Äôt even that bad some are pure powder.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"i should have looked at reviews before i bought, because each pod is individually wrapped in non-recyclable plastic. such a waste of plastics!!!! totally not worth the good deal. i‚Äôd return if possible but they won‚Äôt allow it after opening the seal. i hate to contribute to so much waste, and having to open each package isn‚Äôt very easy and defeats the purpose of having pods for convenience anyways",negative,dishwashing tablet

Leaves a white film after doing the dishes,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I have used a couple other brands of powder pods in my dishwasher, no problems. Those were out of stock, so I tried these instead due to the many positive reviews. First, I don't like that they are individually wrapped. But worse, I noticed my silverware is not getting clean at all. There is still food residue. My plates feel sticky too. Yuck. I am confused by all the good reviews. Did I receive a different product?",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I bought this thinking, it's been 135 years since the invention of the dishwasher; surely all dish detergents are pretty similar right?  And Finish, being owned by a major global CPG company, has to be just as good as anyone else. So when I saw they had a 94 pack for 20% cheaper per unit than the competition, I thought I would make the frugal choice, with bonus points for not having to buy more dish detergent for several months.Unfortunately, this stuff just sucks. Using one Finish pod in a standard size dishwasher, about 1/3 of the dishes would look like I just sprayed some water on them for a minute. In my dishwasher, one pod of Cascade or even Amazon Brand could do the job. I'm now using 2-3 Finish pods for each load, depending on how full it is, and I still get one rogue dish per load that I have to hand wash. In addition, as a minor annoyance, the Finish pods are all individually wrapped, so I have to take them out of their wrapper and send the wrapper to the landfill.Don't think you're saving a few cents with these -- they will end up costing you more money per load, and you'll spend more time hand-washing your dishes afterwards than it took me to write this review.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These do not clean well, we noticed an immediate difference once our other pack of pods from Cascade ran out. Not sure if we‚Äôll finish out the box and hand wash items as needed or if I‚Äôll bite the bullet and just buy some normal (but more expensive) pods that actually work well. These are the least expensive per load for a reason. :(",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Product work well. However, opening the individual wrapped packages is hard for persons who have arthritis in their hands to open the individual soap packages. Therefore, I would not repurchase this product.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I usually use the gel type (Cascade) and took a chance on these.  They are individually packed and at least 1/3 are broken and flake out all over.  I've had some that did not dissolve at all.  I have had to re-wash many items that dd not get dishes clean.  Overall - from now on I will stay with the gel, these were very disappointing to say the least.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I ordered these thinking it was the gel packs.  These are the dry blocks.  With that said, I was NOT expecting the dry blocks to come out of the individual packaging in crumbles.  Mess on the floor when I cut it open, mess trying to get the product in the soap dispenser.  Stuck with a box of disappointment.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I thought with the amount of good reviews and rates plus the price that I was scoring a good deal but in the end all it does is leave dry soap on all my dishes leaving me to need to wash them myself which is obviously not the expectation.

I am intrinsically lazy, so I dont want to do things twice, and if something else will do it for me, so much the better. Yeah, I usually rinse my dishes (when I think about it). But I am not a fan of hand washing as a prewash, and then running it through the dishwasher, and then having to pick stuff and spots off my dishes, which makes me feel like I have to repeat the entire process. I would much rather just use a more ""forgiving"" (better) dishwasher pod, and this isn't it.",negative,dishwashing tablet

They are individually wrapped and every one crumbles in the package like it's old. They are all white-ish in color like they've been sitting for awhile or weather damaged.

Not recyclable.  In addition, at least a dozen of these packets were open and crumbled making them unusable.

In spite of what the product claims, it always leaves food on anything that didn't start out essentially ""clean"" to begin with.  It also leaves residue from the tabs themselves all over everything.  We've had to hand wash things after taking them our of the washer frequently.

I really don't like leaving negative reviews (really don't review anything on here tbh) but sooo many of these things were broken.I see other people had the same problem and make it seem like all were broken... for me that is not the case however a significant amount was broken upon opening. Enough to make me write this. There are times when i would open two in a row to find them broken and have to open a third. I will not repurchase these again. I will not take that risk to possibly recieve more damaged items. Its not worth it.

The ones I normally get from Costco are seal wrapped in a dissolvable clear wrapper and I never have to touch the cleaning product and there is no waste.

While the packaging is appealing they do not appear to be airtight.  It takes a while to get through the whole package as we do not use our dishwasher daily, but most of the tablets seemed to have soaked up some moisture.  This causes them to crumble when the wrapper is opened.  They are still usable, but enough of a reason to switch brands for my next purchase.",negative,dishwashing tablet

"I have been using this product for years and love it. This time even though  I read other reviews re broken pods but still decided to order this type due to good price. Well, got disappointment that I opened few pods to use and most all were broken, crumbled and dried out, powdery appearance. I decided not to use anymore and return. I am changing my brand.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Not as expected. Recently finished this pack and will go back to using my previous brand. Since these packs are not gel, most of the interior will break into pieces when inserting it to the tray.",negative,dishwashing tablet
The package came all mangled and open. One of the tablets broke and there was a powdery residue on everything. I've used other Finish dishwasher tabs but these left a funky residue on 3-5 dishes each time they were used. My husband got annoyed with them so we stopped using them and gave them away. Bummed because it was a pretty good deal.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"This is such a bad product. Leaves my dishes grimy and crusty. I hate that I‚Äôm so cheap I bought this Bc it was cheaper than the competitor. Please don‚Äôt waste your $ on this junk. It doesn‚Äôt work. It makes more work by having to rewash the already ‚Äòwashed‚Äô dishes. Waste of time, money and the packaging is super wasteful.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Buyer beware and count your tabs!  When I opened the box there were several empty tab packages and some just filled with air.  That prompted me to count how many were actually in the box, and it turns out there were only 92 tabs vs. the 94 that there were supposed to be, and 11 empty tab packages.  All the empties were at the top of the box.  The box didn‚Äôt appear tampered with, so don‚Äôt know for sure whether this is a quality control by the maker, or an issue with the seller.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Didn‚Äôt like foil wrapped individual packets.  Should be water soluble packets.,negative,dishwashing tablet
These things are difficult to get out of the foil without getting the powder under your nails. Then almost all the time they crumble. Looking for a different brand now!,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Good product, but each tablet is wrapped in plastic and hard to open.. The plastic wrapping is a non-soluble film. I won‚Äôt buy this again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I like Finish rinse aid but usually use Cascade dishwasher pods which was out of stock when I needed it. Decided to sub with these but was horrified when I opened the box and found that each pod is individually wrapped in plastic! Seems excessively wasteful and will not be ordering these again unless they change the packaging.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I've been buying this product from you for a little bit now and always had good success unfortunately it seems the last two times I purchased this item I've received a poorly made quality product this could be due to just a couple bad batches not sure but upset that my dishes are turning out filthy it becomes costly when you're having to rewash your dishes two to three times just to get them clean from the residue that's left on them from the soap. Thought I'D share this with you. I'm usually pretty satisfied with the product I receive but like I said this last couple times has been a hassle and costly in water and soap to rewash.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I like to price, but is not so efficient as the liquid pod from other brand, the cleaning power is not as desired, and they come with many broken pieces. probably would not buy again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"So I ordered these andA. they are individually wrapped (so annoying)B. They don‚Äôt melt all the way in my dishwasher (which works perfectly with dry powder, gel packs, liquid, etc.)C. Sooo.... I beat them with a small hammer before I open the wrapper (see pics). Then I just throw everything in the bottom of the dishwasher, not in the detergent holder.CANNOT WAIT TO FINISH THESE AND ORDER DIFFERENT ONES!",negative,dishwashing tablet
I have purchased this product 11 times on subscribe and save. The last box I received over 1/2 of the tablets were missing the red ball. I have tried other brands and have found this product cleans the best but if the next box I get is also defective I will cancel my future orders and try another brand with less environmental impact,negative,dishwashing tablet
Left spots,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Very old and crumbly, like they got moisture and then dried out.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I would like a refund on  this purchase, I have tried these several times, for whatever reason they are not dissolving in the dishwasher. I have switch to another brand, no issues.Thanks you!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Whyyyyy are they individually wrapped in plastic/foil packaging?? They are already in a box. Save the planet, people.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Leaves a white residue which required washing fishes in vinegar to remove.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Used only a few times and bought because it was such a good bulk buy deal but every time so far I‚Äôve used them they leave spots on my dishes though I‚Äôm unsure if it could be an issue with my dishwasher,negative,dishwashing tablet
These tablets were cheap.  They crumble in the individually wrapped foil liners.  They left a white film on the dishes.  I tried different temps.  Same results,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Based on many reviews here, I expected this product to work much better than it does.  I finally gave up on it when my kids kept asking if the glasses had been washed, as they all looked dirty after they came out of the washer.  I threw away more than 1/2 of the package and went back to our standby -- Cascade.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Never buy again because they don't disintegrate in my dishwasher so maybe it's made for industrial dishwashers?,negative,dishwashing tablet
"It is called ""All in 1"" but the box recommends using Finish Jet-Dry to dry dishes and prevent spots.  The Finish website does not even mention the existence of ""Powerball"", so I could find no explanation.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"These are supposed to be solid cakes that one drops in the dishwasher. Usually this is the case, but this time most of the individually wrapped cakes have mostly disintegrated. As I open each one up, it tends to leak dust all over. A pain. I made the mistake of waiting too long to contact Amazon and can no longer get a refund. Seems ridiculous considering all of the business I give them.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I must have missed this detail when I purchased. Never buying this again. I'm going back to previous brand Cascade; they are just the pods in a bin.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Due to Covid-19, I have bought this dishwasher detergent online and i regretted. Each piece has a bag and you have to tear the bag each time you use. The inside detergent is power and easy to spill out if you are not careful opening the small bag containing it.The quality compared with Cascade is not a match. My dishes and bowls is not clean like with Cascade.Definitely this is not a worth to try.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I used finish product all the time but this time finish didn‚Äôt do the job what is suppose to do,  good number of  broken tables in package, low quality seller smiling every time they ship one out. I try to find out where it's manufacture but nowhere to be found  or may be hidden under coding,. What a ripe off under Amazon flagship. Please stay away. Little cheap but not that cheap.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Ive used Finish for years and happy with it. Every other pack is crumbled like it's been damp with this particular product tho. I just won't be ordering it from Amazon again.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Each of these is individually wrapped in a foil packet inside the cardboard box, and even with all this packaging almost every one I've used so far has been broken into several pieces within the baggie. I will try not to buy this format again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
These leave a film in my dishwasher and a chalky residue on my dishes. Sometimes they don‚Äôt dissolve all the way. Also the foil wrapping they are individually wrapped in is hard to open and then I have to throw away the garbage. Save yourself time and get a pod style that leaves no garbage and dissolved away. I can not recommend this item from my experience.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Doesn't clean as well as Cascade, and the smell is very chemical-y. Substandard.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Didn't do as good of a job cleaning as the gel ones, in fact it was much worse. Contacted manufacturer to send back unused tablets and got an email saying they will send coupons.",negative,dishwashing tablet
This is an affordable product. However I suggest skipping it. The soap scum left in the dishwasher is crazy. The dishes rarely are clean. I went back to hand washing till I my new cascade pods show up.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"There were 5 washing tablets missing. Only 89 tablets in box, rather than the 94 that is prominently displayed on the box.  These babies are expensive enough without being shortchanged.  Not a happy customer, and they want to know if i want to subscribe and save.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"The packaging of each pod is bit hard to remove (especially with wet hands). But I was hoping that it would do the job well. However lot of my loads are left with powder residues all over the pots and I need to run it again. Using Rinse aid helped a bit, but I still get some loads with powder residue.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I tried these a while back when they were low on cascade.  They leave film, don‚Äôt clean very well and they‚Äôre individually wrapped.  Tossed these in the trash.  The cascade complete pods Kate excellent and kick these pods asses.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Does an okay job cleaning. But this product gets poor marks for wasteful packaging. Every single tablet is packaged in a plastic wrapper, sure to end of in a landfill or ocean. For that very reason people should avoid purchasing this product.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Did my dishwasher even run? Hmm... soap's gone, cups are still wet, but the dishes are dirty...and now they have streaks. These streaks don't just rub off, probably because the plates are still dirty.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Use these pods all the time normally they are great. This is the first time I have ordered them through Amazon and every pod is broken and basically a powder the box itself had the soup powder all over the inside and outside. Very disappointed,negative,dishwashing tablet
Product arrived looking fine but majority of the packets I have opened for use were broken / powdered heavily and not the solid little pod block that was expected.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I find the product did not wash as well as the Cascade I had been using. It did not always dissolve. And the individual wrappers are an annoyance. Back to Cascade!,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Each detergent pod comes in an individual foil wrapper. We‚Äôve opened 10 wrappers so far, and in each one, the detergent has been broken or crumbled. The product has a good price point, but it‚Äôs a mess to use compared to other detergent pod products.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Never used this brand and will never again.  Each tab is individually wrapped in a foil that you have to remove before using.  Not good for the earth and not easy to tear.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Some of the packages turn into powder after several months, and the packages fill with air. Disappointed. Gave 4 stars before, and now change it to 2 stars.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Para ser un producto de jabon en barra para m√°quina de lavavajillas no esperaba un producto de lujo. A√∫n as√≠, la caja estaba maltrecha y las pastillas de jabon en un 15-20% hechas polvo o trituradas. No lo volvere a comprar y usare las que pueda, el resto a la basura.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Bought this because it was slightly cheaper than the cascade pod's I normally use. Most of the individually wrapped pods turned to powder in the packaging and make a mess when opened. Would not recommenced.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Works fine, but 70% of the tablets arrived crumbled. You have to carefully open the wrappers and make sure all the powdery mess gets into the dishwasher bay. The first one I opened made a complete mess in the kitchen and on my clothes.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"This is a great deal, but almost every tab I open is broken. Some are just a few pieces but most are either crumbled or powder. It makes opening them annoying. If I wanted powder I would just buy the powder for a lower price. Im disappointed.",negative,dishwashing tablet
The product is Great but when I received them the majority of the product was broken and crumbled.  I do not know where the liability falls but aggravating!!,negative,dishwashing tablet
Lot more residue/oil/grease left on plates than using cascade. Often have to wash dishes twice using this product,negative,dishwashing tablet
"First box I ordered was totally fine. Second box was like many of the other reviewers stated. Tabs were crumbled inside the package and there were a few tabs not sealed in foil. Will be canceling my Subscribe & Save order and finding something else. Too bad, as the first box was great.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Received a box which was taped up and obviously not new. I counted out the pieces, and it was supposed to have 94, only had 90. Not worth returning and dealing with Amazon about it, but not happy that it was opened.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Love the product results but I have in the past purchased the product with gel tabs that are placed in the DW. This tablet product is wrapped individually and are more of packed powder, so many of the tablets are broken or crumbled. I will stick with gel tabs in future.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Packaging is super thin cardboard! Almost fell apart when removed from delivery box. Upon use of this product we started to get a soapy film buildup in our dishwasher and small unclean areas on dishes. Returned and went back to our other tablets even though a bit more money.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Ok folks. I have been having to use 2 of these units every cycle just to get my dishes clean. No thanks. Going back to Cascade. In the big picture, I didn't really save money.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"This stuff crumbles b4 u can get it in the dishwasher. Another thing white filmy residue over everything. So, washing before & after.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Every pod is individually wrapped in plastic. Not only is this wasteful, but it‚Äôs annoying that I have to unwrap it every time. I just want to toss it in and go. It cleans fine.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Sometimes when i run the dishwasher, my dishes come out clean and normal. Other times it's like i didn't run the dishwasher at all. Dishes that may have had more food stuck to them or something look as dirty as when i put them in. I was hoping to save a little money and have clean dishes but I did not luck out.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Crumbly, pieces broken off.  Bought by mistake, I wanted a dish washer cleaner, not something to clean my dishes.",negative,dishwashing tablet
The outside packing looks okay. when I open it found some white ash from seal. not thinking too much until got an  empty small bag.I took a deeper inspection. found about 3 broken to ash and another 10 just out of the individual bags...No need to return it so should by it from walmart after the Covid..,negative,dishwashing tablet
I have to use two of these things each time or the dishes dont come fully clean even with a prewash. Feels like such a waste!,negative,dishwashing tablet
"The most of the individual packets where/are crumbly on the inside in little pieces! It might be a knock off, a NOT GENUINE PRODUCT!",negative,dishwashing tablet
They are wrapped in a small plastic wrapping which I think is unnecessary because they seem to hold themselves together just fine.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I dislike wrestling with the wrapper to get the tablet out. The majority of the time, i can tell they are crushed long before I finally get it open. Now, I cut the end off with kitchen scissors - - the tablet is almost always crushed but the red ball is intact! I won't be ordered these again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
All the soap pods came in crumbled. We had to ‚Äúpour‚Äù powder into the dishwasher dispenser. We canceled our subscription for this product.  This is/was so annoying.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I bought this over a month ago but I just opened it and started using it the last 2 weeks and all of the pieces are broken.,negative,dishwashing tablet
This created a gross coral colored greasy build up all over the bottom of my dishwasher. I used white vinegar and a toothbrush to scrub the filter but still don‚Äôt know if it will ever be 100%. Switching to a different brand.,negative,dishwashing tablet
These tabs do not disintegrate in my dishwasher like other Finish tabs 50%of the time. It is frustrating and I will not buy again.,negative,dishwashing tablet
The box must be 20 years old. The tabs are all broken and disintegrating.  Still using but it is making a dif in the cleaning of my dishes.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I get these on subscribe and save, so when I received nicely taped box I noticed the tape, but didn't pay much attention and just put it in the storage, since I had pods remaining from previous delivery. I opened the box yesterday and found it had only 76 pods instead of 94.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Cleans great, I didn‚Äôt realize each tab was individually wrapped. Won‚Äôt buy again- foolish waste toWrap them all.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"This seems to be from a bad batch for the regular price. About 40% of the pods are missing the red ball which is why I even buy these, for the extra cleaning power. Won‚Äôt be ordering again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
This item has individual foil wraps for each pod. There is no reason for this environmentally bad idea and it's a time suck to unwrap them little buggers.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Used to work great. Now doesn't disolve entirely through entire wash. Have to setup extra rinse cycles and usually leaves a powdery film on plastics that must be hand rinsed and wiped off or you can get diarrhea. Why do they change a product that worked? Changing to another brand.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I always use this product and it works well for me, but the last shipment of them had been crushed. Open the package and powder flies everywhere. I brought them ahead, so too late for a return once I discovered this.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Evidently these were very old as about 8 of 10 are not intact pellets but instead are powder.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Ugh. If it weren‚Äôt for the pandemic, we would still be buying Kroger brand dishwasher pods and be satisfied. These are absolute garbage! We have to have every speck of food off the dishes and have all greasiness washed away, or the dishes are still dirty!",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Majority of the tabs are smashed to crumbs! Poor individual wrappers. I purchased an 80 something count package of the same brand, and they were fine. I guess this Mega Pack has a poorer quality, due to it's quantity.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I really like to use the product.  That is why I gave the review a 2.  The box was not damaged nor opened.  The damage was done prior to shipping from the distributor...Reckitt Benckiser.  We received 60 unopened pods, 22 open pods, at least 14 (simple math) were ""Nothing But Dust"".  My simple math did not work for me on this one.  Sigh!Ordered 3/31 and received 4/2.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"At least half, if not more of these dishwashing tablets are missing the ""powerball""!  I will not be purchasing them again!",negative,dishwashing tablet
Each pod is individually wrapped -- why? There is no need for this. This brand leaves a lot of water spots on my dishes. I will not order this again.,negative,dishwashing tablet
THIS PRODUCT WAS DELIVERED IN BAD CONDITION.  THE BOX WAS IN TACT BUT THE INDIVIDUAL PACKAGES ONCE OPENED CONTAINED BROKEN PIECES AND POWDERED REMAINS OF THE DISHWASHER TABS.  I WILL NOT ORDER THIS AGAIN.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"The product itself is great. I use this brand all the time. This is the first time purchasing it from Amazon. The box was not damaged at all but when I opened it there was white power all over. Multiple pods were broken open, crumbled or packaging attached In sets of 2-3. I kept the product due to it still being useful and putting opened pods in a separate container but I definitely lost 5-7 pods due to damage.",negative,dishwashing tablet
I think it does a decent cleaning job for the price but one third of the individual wrapped detergent cubes are busted! What a mess and hassle.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"2 Stars instead of 1 because the packets appear to work for the most part, but they are ALL broken.  They crumble as soon as I start to open each individual packet.  I have to stand directly over the compartment they need to placed in so I can quickly shove the contents where they need to go and hope that I don't make a huge mess each time.  Disappointed.",negative,dishwashing tablet
The box was open inside the package. Many of the pods were outside the box in the plastic packaging. The pods outside the box were crushed and broken. Although usable in the dishwasher it makes it difficult to put in the reservoir.,negative,dishwashing tablet
This product leaves a film on some dishes. I‚Äôm not pleased and will not purchase again,negative,dishwashing tablet
"These are pretty horrible. At the time it was the only available option due to people COVID hoarding so I decided to try. The tablets do not dissolve, we have to run the dishwasher twice and the dishes still aren‚Äôt getting clean! Can‚Äôt wait to buy anything else to replace these.",negative,dishwashing tablet
It leaves white residue,negative,dishwashing tablet
This product is average at best. Sometimes it is effective other times it is not. It does not always dissolve properly. Using two instead of one helps but that should not be necessary. There are better products out there for only a few dollars more.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Opened the box only to find a large majority of the tabs crushed, Destroyed and out of packaging the out side of the box looks perfectly fine however once opened there were a bunch of empty packages sitting at the very top",negative,dishwashing tablet

I love finish dishwashing tabs but unfortunately this box I ordered 1- took a while to get to my home and when it did arrive 2- the packaging was completely damaged and every single tab was broken and basically powder.,negative,dishwashing tablet
First of all the fact that they're individually wrapped is a pain. Especially since they don't clean well so I have to use 2 pods per load. For that cost I'm going to buy the more expensive stuff that actually works. Also they're all beat up so when you open one you get powder all over the place.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I have used probably 15 of the packets so far and only one had the power ball in it!,negative,dishwashing tablet
Get cascade or even great value brand - this doesn't desolve and leaves powder residue on everything,negative,dishwashing tablet
"The product does a good job cleaning my dishes, but many of the tablets  were broken/crumbled, despite the box showing no signs of damage. This has happened twice and it's an inconvenience, and the only reason I'm switching back to Cascade Platinum.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Suppose to have 94 tabs but lot of packets are just empty and sealed. Sending less tabs then its suppose to have.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Only one tablet at a time didn't work I had to use two tablets to get my dishes clean. I do Rinse my dishes well before I put them into the dishwasher so there's no reason for one tablet not doing the job but it didn't. I buy Cascade platinum and one pod works great,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Each pod is individually wrapped, which is a waste, environmentally irresponsible, and inconvenient for quick and easy use. Still gets dishes clean.",negative,dishwashing tablet
These clean ok but not great. They are little powder bricks that come in individual packs that are difficult to rip open. The bricks often crumble before you get to use them.Adds too much time to washing the dishes so we just keep them as backups for when we run out of the good ones.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Disappointed with the overall quality of this dishwasher detergent. Glasses come out opaque and with water spots. I previously used a different detergent and did not have this problem. Dishes also come out with a bit of a wet dog odor. Not at all happy with this detergent.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"The product itself is fine, but the packs end up being pulverized to dust by the post.  Unfortunately, the convenience of the shipping doesn't matter when the shipping and packaging are inadequate.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Ive ordered this product before and been very happy with it i would consider it a good value and it worked as good or better than other brands! This shipment is terrible i can't tell if the tablets were crushed or got wet somehow but a good share are in powder form in the packets?! Others are broken into many pieces?!,negative,dishwashing tablet
I did not like that you had to individually unwrap each one to use.  Otherwise did a decent job,negative,dishwashing tablet
I think these dish washing pods are over packaging and therefore troublesome to use. The other brands do not have individual packaging and they worked better. It left streaks on my pits and pans. I will not buy them again.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Good product, but each tablet is wrapped in plastic. Finish can and does produce the same thing wrapped in a soluble film. I won‚Äôt buy this again.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Got these for more then the stuff I usually buy and I regret it. Leaves spots on everything. I wouldn‚Äôt suggest this.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I thought it was a good product 4 the name  Does not get dishes clean üò†,negative,dishwashing tablet
The box was busted but the item did ship in a large box with other stuff. Cascade is way better for the water in my area. These leave film on my dishes.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Pods do not dissolve therefore do not clean. Now I have a box full of these I can‚Äôt return.,negative,dishwashing tablet
The product appeared old. A lot of the pods were either broken or crushed.,negative,dishwashing tablet
thought I was getting what I ordered last time which was the newer packs of powerball all in one - the ones with a clear wrap that dissolves in the heat and water.  Instead I got the OLD OLD type which is wrapped in silvery wrapping that I had to cut off.  NOT what I thought.  Look carefully as the packages look the same.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Most of the tablets are broken and whenever you open the packets the tablets are in, the product crumbles and spills out all over your hand.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"I have been using these tabs/pods regularly so decided to order them on Amazon. The ones I had used previously were wrapped in clear cellulose that dissolves in water, which I found very convenient.

Several tablets are broken. Some of them don‚Äôt completely dissolve even after running three cycles and leaves hard to clean residues on my dishes. It was a total waster of money.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"Annoying and wasteful, does not come with storage container",negative,dishwashing tablet
"It's sort of convenient. That's pretty much it.It has the same occasional issue that powder has where it will not dissolve completely.Otherwise as packaged, it essentially breaks into powder as you open the individually wrapped packets.Doesn't seem to clean any better than cascade packs or powder",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Bought this because it was recommended as a septic system safe option. I‚Äôm considering throwing it all out even though I HATE wasting. It leaves soap residue all over the dishes, not even just glasses. I did not have this problem with the previous liquid detergent I used so I don‚Äôt think it is an issue with the mineral content of the water.",negative,dishwashing tablet
Individually wrapped are no good for seniors with arthritis and limited ability in their hands.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I just used a pod, my dishes seem clean, no cleaner or less clean than other brands that I notice on my first run. The reason for the two stars is this - these pods are individually packaged!

Many of our tablets are completely crushed which makes them difficult to use,negative,dishwashing tablet
This is not a good dishwasher detergent. I am going to buy extra liquid fpr rinsing aid otherwise i can't even finish the box. Diahes come out dirty. Film on the glass. My previous detergent did the job better. Wished i spent more money ok n better product,negative,dishwashing tablet
"The tablets were broken and several of the tablet wrappers were broken, causing the resulting power to be left everywhere.",negative,dishwashing tablet
They work fine. Individual wrapping is awful and unnecessary. Won‚Äôt be buying again for that reason alone.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Many of the tablets were broken inside their wrapper.  It was like dumping powder on the tablet rack.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Tabs are not as effective on soiled dishes as other brands. I found spots and food particles on forks and plates. Rewashing required on some loads.,negative,dishwashing tablet
"I didn‚Äôt know when I ordered these that they. Amen individually wrapped (vs. drop in). Also, each one seems to be a second. They‚Äôre almost all crumbled and one even came completely crumbled with 2 red balls instead of just one. Ok. They work the same. Just not impressed.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"Majority of the tabs are broken...thankfully they were all individually wrapped so I could just dump the broken pieces and crumbs into the dishwasher cubby easily.

"Good price but some come empty, broken, missing the power ball not to impressed",negative,dishwashing tablet
I'll never buy this again. The powder stayed in some of the plates most of the time and I really don't feel like clean them pretty well. I'll try the liquid osao pads next time. Can't wait for this one's to be gone.,negative,dishwashing tablet
Very disappointed as many of the tablets were broken within their individual packages.,negative,dishwashing tablet
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs my dish washer or the product but every time I used this specific brand there was always a nasty film or residue on the dishes. I switched to a different brand and new had the issue again. They‚Äôre all single wrapped pods which was nice!,negative,dishwashing tablet

"Gets my dishes clean for the most part, but the power ball has a bad habit of chipping and even breaking my dishes.

These don‚Äôt work very well and they leave a gritty residue on your dishes. The gel packs from this same brand work better. I don‚Äôt recommend these.,negative,dishwashing tablet

"Let me start off by saying that we have a very expensive and very clean dishwasher, and usually use Cascade. After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try, so I bought a larger box of the solid pellets. I bought these because of the concerns with the other ones sticking together in the box like many people had complained about, so I gave these a try, and I made sure that I had the liquid dryer full as well, and even after the first heavy duty wash, which is over three hours long, I noticed that there was residue, running down the door because the pellet apparently didn‚Äôt dissolve 100%. That was pretty much a bummer right there, but I gave it another chance, and we ended up with the same thing, the other thing it was quite disappointing is, there is no fresh scent, it‚Äôs just a regular soapy odor and now I wish I had not spent the money to buy the large box..I realize that others may have a different experience, but this was my experience, and I will not be buying these again",neutral,dishwashing tablet

The packaging is really just completely lame, so I'll stick to another kind of dishwasher tabs in the future.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"The detergent is a great value and works well. The individual packaging is terrible, it is difficult to open and the process of opening them gets the high powered detergent on your hands.

Finish has been on my Subscription list for a couple years. Cleaned dishes great and left our dishwasher spotless.

These soap cubes are individually wrapped in foil. Try opening these when your hands are wet!  Very unhappy with the switch. Otherwise the soap works well.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"With these pods they are individually foil wrapped. Since they're not dissolvable, you have to open each one for your dishwasher load.

All right so I needed some new dishwasher detergent. I‚Äôve never use these before and it looked interesting. They were pretty affordable and easy to use as I just pop them in my dishwasher. The only problem I have is all the extra waste. Each one is individually packed in a foil container. But I do understand why as most of them are crumbled inside the package. They are super cute and they seem to work well. But the extra waste in plastic is bothering me.

"This product is EXTREMELY inconvenient to use. I initially selected it because I thought the only thing that counts is cleaning power. However each pod is packages in a difficult to open package. My kids are in charge to do the dishwasher and they cannot open them and always require help. If your fingers are just a tiny bit wet it's impossible to open them even as a strong adult. I can't imagine the elderly having to deal with this. Even after cutting the package open with scissors it didn't want to come out. For me it's back buying the pods that have a layer that dissolves when in contact with water, so that the kids can use them without requiring help. Dear Finish, remember, you can have the best product in the world but ruin it with inconvenience. I have to admit the product had plenty of cleaning power - we always run it with liquid detergent in the pre-wash program.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

"‚Ä¢ Product arrived quickly.Stars remaining: 5/5‚Ä¢ Dislike the wasted packaging used for each tab, although this seems to be unavoidable due to the design of the tabs (seeing so many tabs broken when I open the package, they would probably fall apart before the box was ever opened if they weren‚Äôt individually wrapped).I deducted 2/5 stars for the waste because this is harder for me to deal with than my next issue. I would return a star if I thought this was completely unavoidable. I‚Äôm not sure if this much waste outweighs a tad more adhesive to keep each tab together, or a completely different design altogether.Stars remaining: 3/5‚Ä¢ Doesn‚Äôt work as well as I‚Äôm used to. Running a dishwashing cycle using Finish All in 1 won‚Äôt even clean fingerprints off your glasses! Complete prewash is required. Cleans better than the next level down within the Finish brand dishwasher tabs, still not near well enough in my book.

"I was very disappointed when I received the box of Finish dishwasher tabs.  I buy these all the time at the store but found this great price on Amazon.  Now I know why the price was so low.  As you can see from the photos, these are damaged tabs that are lumped into one box.  Some were wrapped, some unwrapped, some wrappers open and some tabs were broken.  The box was in perfect condition and sealed.  Also, this is OLD stock.  Since I do purchase these on a regular basis I know what they look like and the current presentation is that each tab is in a clear, biodegradable shrink wrap that goes directly into the machine and dissolves, not a metallic colored plastic that has to be removed prior to use.  In reading other reviews of this particular product it seems other buyers have had similar experiences.

It is difficult to find what you are actually buying in the box because all of these are called ""Power Ball.""  The pictures on the outside ALL show the about the same pod with NO reference to the outer wrapping.  I prefer the soluble wrap, but now I have 94 in foil wrap.  I see several reviews with split wrappers (which did not happen with the water soluble pods). The descriptions of Power Ball, Power ball MAX, Power ball Ultimate do not give a very good description of the actual product in the package. The attached picture shows the one I really wanted (with the water soluble wrap on it) and the one I received.  NOT described on the box. Good cleaner, poor packaging description.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"All of the tablets came individually wrapped but the wrapping on most of them was broken and the majority of the tablets were damaged or crushed. There was powder all over the inside of the box and it's super messy tearing them open and using them. Obviously I could still just dump the powder into my dishwasher and it did the job, but the product itself was kind of crummy. Cascade pods are way better, but these were better than nothing since everything was sold out due to Covid. You get 96 of them though so it lasts a long time. I run the dishwasher like everyday so that was a plus. I also have a Finish 'certified' dishwasher so that probably helped idk maybe the wash cycle is more compatible with the way these dissolve. I won't buy them again though once better products become available again. They're inconsistent and messy and kind of annoying honestly. But they do work so whatever I guess. I feel like amazon was just selling defective boxes of this to make a buck. Decent value otherwise.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Not entirely happy with this product. They do clean the dishes, mostly, and I have not noticed any leftover residue on the dishes. It seems to rinse clean in the dishwasher without leaving a bunch of spots. It arrived promptly, which is good, however, many of the tablets have been broken. Which would be annoying but okay, if each individual packet they were wrapped in were securely closed or sealed, and if the packets would dissolve in the dishwasher. The packets must be torn open and thrown away, creating more waste. They do come packed in a cardboard box, which can be recycled in my area.The individual packets can be difficult to open. When that happens, and the cube inside is broken, the detergent powder flies out and gets on your hands. Make sure you're holding the packet over the dishwasher door when you open them.In a nutshell, they clean our dishes, but they can be irksome to use, and the packaging waste is a disappointment. We won't buy them again.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

It does work effectively. I can't complain there. We only start the dishwasher when it's full too. However having to open the foil and finding broken bits & pieces is a big let down. Even my husband was annoyed when he went to load the dishwasher and start it. I also use the Finish Rinse Aid which makes a difference too.

Each night, I threw away plastic waste that seemed unnecessary. Despite how wonderfully this product worked, I will probably be going with a different brand from this point forward.That being said, if you are concerned about small children mistaking your dishwasher tablets for candy, these may make you feel at ease!

The product is fine as usual but all the packets crumble when opened. Very messy to use. Will not order again.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"They work good I kinda get annoyed after doing dishes ready to throw one in the dishwasher and they all are individually packaged, so my hands being wet and trying to open the tiny packaging can be a struggle. If I use 1 it doesn't work the best but if I use 2 it works great!",neutral,dishwashing tablet
These tablets work fine generally. I do use a rinse aid along with these and the dishes tend to come out OK. One gripe i do have is that the tablets have a tendency to get smashed in the box. When you open them up you need to be careful or you could end up with dumping it unintentionally.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
These are not covered with the clear wrappers,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"To use, you have to open a foil packet. At least half of the tablets are powdered and crumbling. I often find white residue in pans and glasses. I know the water is hot enough because you can't touch it from the faucet and I use high heat wash. After 2 boxes, I've canceled my subscription and won't be using these any more.  Finish Quantuum does a better job, but I'm switching brands.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Description did not mention that tablets were wrapped in foil packages. So every time you open one you have waste and end up touching the tablet. Will not buy this again.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"About half the dishwasher tabs have crumbled inside the foil package and little red ball in the top middle has come loose. I end up using twice as many because I throw the crumbled tab pieces into the washer bottom and then open another tab until I find one that is not broken and put the whole tab into the tab compartment on the door.In the past I used FINISH tabs that were wrapped in a clear plastic that must melt in the hot water and they were never broken, cracked, or crumbled. It's a good product but watch what your buying.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I loved the convenience of buying the larger box of Finish dishwasher detergent  and I love the results for using Finish. However, in this particular box of dish washer detergent tabs, many of the individual packets were either empty or damaged.  This was the case more often  than not, more damaged or missing tabs than intact usable. The product works great, just not impressed with the packaging and count.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Quality product at a good price, we've purchased it before, and like using it for our dishes.  The box arrived slightly damaged, but not too terrible.  As we're using them, I find that about half of the dishwasher pods are broken inside their individual packets.They still seem to work okay, mostly.  I can't help but wonder if they are slightly less effective than they were designed to be because of the broken tablets dissolving differently than designed.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Great item &  Seller,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I used this whole box before switching to another brand. What a difference with the new pods. These barely cleaned the dishes and unwrapping the foil caused a mess. Dust would get on the counter and little pieces of foil would stick to my fingers. Others have said this was either fake or old, but I won't be taking that chance again with Finish. I would have stopped using them earlier, but I thought the cleaning problem was with the dishwasher.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
If you don‚Äôt mind then all being in plastic then this is perfect for youI don‚Äôt like it because I would rather just throw them in side then to have to open it and then throw it inside,neutral,dishwashing tablet
I am very disappointed with these pods.All individually wrapped and thus far all hard to open and very messy.I will never buy these pods again. Unfortunately I have to get through all of these crappy pods 1st,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I was buying the smaller boxes of these and they worked well. This larger box, not so much. The tablets are smaller and I‚Äôve been having problems with the powder not dissolving completely. I always have white powdery residue on the dishwasher wall and some of the dishes. The gel type work really well but cost more. However, I won‚Äôt be buying this bulk box anymore.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Received the box of tabs but have not been as pleased with the results as I would have expected based on the reviews I read. It cleans my dishes adequately and as expected, however, it leaves what feels almost like a film of dust on the dishes that have forced me to rinse off my dishes again after having run the dishwasher and just letting them air dry in the dishwasher. This has not occurred previously (having recently used a dishwasher cleaner and powder dish detergent in the dispenser several uses prior to these), so I can only surmise that this product is the culprit. Will likely try a different brand and/or product after this disappointing experience.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
was easy to open and place in dishwasher  but did not clean as good as cascade,neutral,dishwashing tablet

It sometimes traps the red powerball so that it doesn‚Äôt dissolve either, the gel packs are a LOT better.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

"This is a detergent I have been using happily for quite a while now. However I'm not happy with this particular delivery.The box looked kind of old and pretty beat up once packaging was taken off. As expected, around one 3rd of the packets either broken in half or basically pulverized.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

"We have always been satisfied with FINISH, but in our last order, the pods were crushed, the soap in pieces. The box was not crushed. That tells me that crushed pods were put in the box.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"When compared to other products, these are a good price, but not a great value. The quality is not very good.Our usual store-brand Kroger dishwasher pods do a significantly better job for about the same price.Also, all of the pods are individually wrapped in non-recyclable plastic, which seems really unnecessary. There has to be a better way to do this, using an easily recyclable wrapper.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Didn't realize that each pod is individually wrapped. Would not have ordered if I knew about this because it generates excess waste. Will not be ordering again.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"When fresh, and intact, they clean well. However, upon opening, there were loose unwrapped tabs mixed in, but there were no loose wrappers in box, so this happened during mfg. Also, some wrappers were 1/2 open, exposing tabs, & some were completely sealed, but crumbled inside the packaging. There were powdered crumbs throughout box. See photo. Also, good to check mfgr date embossed on top flap. Per mfgr, these are good 24 mos from that date. This is true. Last box ordered, had less than 1yr of freshness. Last 2 mos they began to crumble, red ball not dissolving properly, & didn‚Äôt clean as well.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
This product just isn‚Äôt the best for our particular dish washer. We typically buy cheaper generic versions and this name brand product leaves white specks on our dishes after running thought the intense cycle.  We have to rinse them by hand afterward.  Sometimes name brand is not the best solution.  We use a Frigidaire dishwasher.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
This is the second time I have ordered this product. I‚Äôm not sure if Amazon is shipping old product or what?? The item arrived busted open and covered in residue.The actual pods are broken up in their individual bags and appear old.I hope they work ok but presentation wise this is a fail.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
Ok so this is my first experience with finish. I normally go with a more natural brand. But in these hard times I thought let's get the one that will last the longest. From what I see on commercials this stuff is supposed to be like number one dishwasher cleaner.. I'm not impressed. I've had cheap walmart pods work better than this stuff. It leave dishes not very clean. And some food left over.,neutral,dishwashing tablet

No complaint about the price or the job it does.

"Let me start off by saying that we have a very expensive and very clean dishwasher, and usually use Cascade. After reading the reviews for this product, I decided to give it a try, so I bought a larger box of the solid pellets. I bought these because of the concerns with the other ones sticking together in the box like many people had complained about, so I gave these a try, and I made sure that I had the liquid dryer full as well, and even after the first heavy duty wash, which is over three hours long, I noticed that there was residue, running down the door because the pellet apparently didn‚Äôt dissolve 100%. That was pretty much a bummer right there, but I gave it another chance, and we ended up with the same thing, the other thing it was quite disappointing is, there is no fresh scent, it‚Äôs just a regular soapy odor and now I wish I had not spent the money to buy the large box..I realize that others may have a different experience, but this was my experience, and I will not be buying these again",neutral,dishwashing tablet

The packaging is really just completely lame, so I'll stick to another kind of dishwasher tabs in the future.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"The detergent is a great value and works well. The individual packaging is terrible, it is difficult to open and the process of opening them gets the high powered detergent on your hands.

I can't imagine the elderly having to deal with this. Even after cutting the package open with scissors it didn't want to come out. For me it's back buying the pods that have a layer that dissolves when in contact with water, so that the kids can use them without requiring help.

"‚Ä¢ Product arrived quickly.Stars remaining: 5/5‚Ä¢ Dislike the wasted packaging used for each tab, although this seems to be unavoidable due to the design of the tabs (seeing so many tabs broken when I open the package, they would probably fall apart before the box was ever opened if they weren‚Äôt individually wrapped).I deducted 2/5 stars for the waste because this is harder for me to deal with than my next issue. I would return a star if I thought this was completely unavoidable. I‚Äôm not sure if this much waste outweighs a tad more adhesive to keep each tab together, or a completely different design altogether.Stars remaining: 3/5‚Ä¢ Doesn‚Äôt work as well as I‚Äôm used to. Running a dishwashing cycle using Finish All in 1 won‚Äôt even clean fingerprints off your glasses! Complete prewash is required.

"I was very disappointed when I received the box of Finish dishwasher tabs.  I buy these all the time at the store but found this great price on Amazon.  Now I know why the price was so low.  As you can see from the photos, these are damaged tabs that are lumped into one box.  Some were wrapped, some unwrapped, some wrappers open and some tabs were broken.  The box was in perfect condition and sealed.  Also, this is OLD stock.  Since I do purchase these on a regular basis I know what they look like and the current presentation is that each tab is in a clear, biodegradable shrink wrap that goes directly into the machine and dissolves, not a metallic colored plastic that has to be removed prior to use.

"These tablets always leave a weird film on my dishes. We have a newer dishwasher and they always seem dirty. And yes, I scrub (with blue dawn) my dishes off before they go into the dishwasher.If my kids load the dishwasher and I don‚Äôt see my pans in there, they come out with the strangest white/silver film on them.I‚Äôve never liked the finish tablets and these were purchased in a pinch.

The box arrived and it looked OK. 94 tabs. But I was annoyed to open the cardboard box and find 94 tabs individually wrapped in plastic.  What a waste.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
I like the product but I wish they were unwrapped.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
individually wrapped. To difficult for me to open. With very sensitive skin this really isn‚Äôt a good product for me to handle getting it out of the package.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I love this product, but not the foil wrap. I accidentally bought the wrong ones. I have the hardest time getting that foil off each time. So my husband will unwrap several ahead for me to use each week.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
They don‚Äôt have an overpowering scent. Though I wish they cleaned a little better than they do. Even used with Jet Dry I get hard water spots. Next time I‚Äôll try something different. I bought these cause of the price.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
Apparently this is a well known problem.  I purchased the box of 96 in May of 2021.  I have found that approximately one half of the pods are turning to powder in the sealed packages.  It seems that I am not the only one experiencing this problem.  I have kept using them even though some are broken but others are fine.  I do notice a decrease in the cleaning ability of the broken ones.  I thought this was a great deal but now I will use another brand.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
I didn't realize each tab was individually packaged.  I just can't order again . . . too much guilt over all the packaging!,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"The tabs themselves are o.k. They seem to clean the dishes. The problem is with the tabs, each individual soap pack is wrapped in a little plastic foil. Even if you don't care about the environmental aspect of the product unwrapping a soap pack that you just took out of a larger pack?",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Good product, must come from china because took 4 extra days to deliver",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Just switched from cascade and will be finding something else or switching back.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
It does not clean the dishes properly. It does not shine the glasses and leaves traces of detergent.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"This is a very good dish cleaner for automatic dishwashers.  I have used them for years. BUT I REALLY wish there was more information on the outside of the box. When we started using this brand, the pods were gel wrapped in water soluble wrap, then the next was solid powder in water soluble wrapper, and now (it seems) there is a foil wrapper which must be removed with each wash. It is difficult to find what you are actually buying in the box because all of these are called ""Power Ball.""  The pictures on the outside ALL show the about the same pod with NO reference to the outer wrapping.  I prefer the soluble wrap, but now I have 94 in foil wrap.  I see several reviews with split wrappers (which did not happen with the water soluble pods). The descriptions of Power Ball, Power ball MAX, Power ball Ultimate do not give a very good description of the actual product in the package. The attached picture shows the one I really wanted (with the water soluble wrap on it) and the one I received.  NOT described on the box. Good cleaner, poor packaging description.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"All of the tablets came individually wrapped but the wrapping on most of them was broken and the majority of the tablets were damaged or crushed. There was powder all over the inside of the box and it's super messy tearing them open and using them. Obviously I could still just dump the powder into my dishwasher and it did the job, but the product itself was kind of crummy. Cascade pods are way better, but these were better than nothing since everything was sold out due to Covid. You get 96 of them though so it lasts a long time. I run the dishwasher like everyday so that was a plus. I also have a Finish 'certified' dishwasher so that probably helped idk maybe the wash cycle is more compatible with the way these dissolve. I won't buy them again though once better products become available again. They're inconsistent and messy and kind of annoying honestly. But they do work so whatever I guess. I feel like amazon was just selling defective boxes of this to make a buck. Decent value otherwise.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Not entirely happy with this product. They do clean the dishes, mostly, and I have not noticed any leftover residue on the dishes. It seems to rinse clean in the dishwasher without leaving a bunch of spots. It arrived promptly, which is good, however, many of the tablets have been broken. Which would be annoying but okay, if each individual packet they were wrapped in were securely closed or sealed, and if the packets would dissolve in the dishwasher. The packets must be torn open and thrown away, creating more waste. They do come packed in a cardboard box, which can be recycled in my area.The individual packets can be difficult to open. When that happens, and the cube inside is broken, the detergent powder flies out and gets on your hands. Make sure you're holding the packet over the dishwasher door when you open them.In a nutshell, they clean our dishes, but they can be irksome to use, and the packaging waste is a disappointment. We won't buy them again.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
The biggest complaint I have is that they are individually wrapped. I really wasn‚Äôt wanting that but that‚Äôs just how they are they seem to work OK but is not top-quality. They are crumbly,neutral,dishwashing tablet
Very difficult to use due to wrapper.. needs to have dissolving clear coating. Dangerous looks like candy,neutral,dishwashing tablet
Tabs seemed old and were very crumbly. In cellophane indv wrapped and hard to open without sissors. Will not buy again.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Instead of max-in-1 which I normally buy, I bought this by mistake. It came in a cardboard box, which is nice. But every tab is individually wrapped, not very environmentally friendly.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I have always used and like Finish for my dishwasher, but why do they have to be individually wrapped? Such a waste:-(",neutral,dishwashing tablet
I don‚Äôt usually start the dishwasher in our house so we are a 1/4 through the box when I realized the majority of the tablets are missing their red powerball center. Won‚Äôt buy again.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"These pods work good for their intended purpose.  I guess clean dishes are clean dishes, right?  However, I do want to warn that approximately 40% of these pods are missing the red ball that Finish advertises as being part of the product.  Have I noticed a major decrease in quality in the pods that are missing the ball? No, not really?  Do I think that I was sold a defective batch on purpose?  Absolutely.  Probably won‚Äôt buy again as there is not a significant discount to make up for the defective product.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Although this is cheaper, I won‚Äôt buy it again for a couple  reasons. 1. It‚Äôs harmful for the metals utensils. I used my dishwasher for a while, the old brand dishwasher pod was ok for all my utensils. However, I found that me metal utensils got some rusty dots on them. 2. It doesn‚Äôt protect glass that much. My wine glasses have some scratches on it after a couple days using this pods. 3. The pod never dissolved totally, it always left some solid soap after every cycles. I tried to used hot water, but it still not dissolved well. 4. The package is not good too. Some of it are broken, so the box was messy when I first open it.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
I received the Finish and the box was damaged.,neutral,dishwashing tablet

The tablet is not dissolving,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I was surprised when I open the box and found foil wrapped pods that I had to open and not the usual clear pods that I could just pop in dishwasher tray. Once I started opening the foil then the real surprise started happening. About 90% of the time the ""pod"" was broken! So it was a bit of a mess to load in it's ""compartment"". It does work effectively. I can't complain there. We only start the dishwasher when it's full too. However having to open the foil and finding broken bits & pieces is a big let down. Even my husband was annoyed when he went to load the dishwasher and start it. I also use the Finish Rinse Aid which makes a difference too. Even though it does the job I can say I won't be ordering this again, sadly. I am going to try the Quantum instead. Only because my dishwasher manufacturer suggested I use this brand.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"The finish brand of dishwasher tablets uses the ‚Äúhardened powder‚Äù approach as opposed to encapsulated liquid. The tablets usually dissolve and clean my dishes just fine. I never find streaks or water marks. In fact, I would venture to say that the tablets do their job wonderfully.However, as someone who tries very hard to reduce the amount of plastic waste I produce, I was disappointed with having each tablet individually wrapped in foil. Each night, I threw away plastic waste that seemed unnecessary. Despite how wonderfully this product worked, I will probably be going with a different brand from this point forward.That being said, if you are concerned about small children mistaking your dishwasher tablets for candy, these may make you feel at ease! I, however, look forward to the day I can use finish without feeling guilty about producing excess plastic trash.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Although this is usually a good product the Box that I got has a considerable number of the tablets seemingly humid and swollen inside their wrapper.  So good product but I didn't get a fresh box.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I use finish rinse aid, so I thought I would give these a try. However, I wasn‚Äôt impressed. Didn‚Äôt get everything clean. I don‚Äôt get any residue on anything though. I always run my sink faucet at hot for a minute before running a cycle though.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Each pod is individually wrapped so it‚Äôs super wasteful. They work fine. Won‚Äôt buy again because of the packaging.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
So far it‚Äôs done well cleaning dishes but a few of the tabs have been broken. Also not a fan of individually wrapped cleaning tabs.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
They are always cracked into pieces when I get them. Hate that. They don‚Äôt clean like they use to so I‚Äôm trying the better ones with extra cleaning power.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Compared to what you'd pay locally, the price is definitely worth it for these.  However, the quality control is all over the map.  There are empty silver pouches in the box where there should be dishwasher tabs.  Some of the tabs were crushed upon open the pouch even though I had just taken it out of the box.  Still a much cheaper alternative.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Beware- you must unwrap each tablet before using it which is kind of a pain.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
It doesn't clean as good as the Costco brand and also they come in individual packages that you have to open and throw away not like the ones from Costco that come in a dissolvable plastic just like the tide pods do,neutral,dishwashing tablet

"We have very hard water, I prefer my regular brand but it has just gotten way too expensive.  This cleans alright just leaves hard water stains on the glassware.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I will never order these again - they work well enough (although not as well as Cascade pods). BUT - you're standing there with wet, slipper, icky hands, from handling and rinsing your dirty dishes - and you have to tear off this ridiculously hard-to-remove little wrapper from the pod before you can use it. You don't want to start the tear with your teeth, or grab a scissor, because of the junk on your hands. So you have to wash and dry your hands in order to open them. Can you say annoying? Nope.

"These are not the ones that are in a plastic wrap that disintegrates in water, these come wrapped in silver foil and MUST BE UNWRAPPED before use. This really needs to be made very clear in the item description but it is not, it only says ""dishwasher tablets,"" and they are wrapped tablets so if you don't remove the wrap, you will still have exactly what you put in there when the machine is done. (like running the dishwasher without any soap).**The wrap is waterproof!**Sure, you may save a few cents, but it's not worth it.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Seems, or acts like, tablets vary in size and some not use able, may have absorbed moisture from room? If so the packaging vacuums....once trimmed and loaded they work fine.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
My only complaint is that when I take the pods out of the wrapper they‚Äôre broken. It‚Äôs annoying having to empty a bunch of crumbs into my dishwasher so I end up throwing out the broken ones.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I have used this product for a while now, and have really enjoyed it. I ordered this box online because I was too lazy to go to the store. It came in a cardboard box that had been sloshing around inside another cardboard box. Every time I open one of the individual packets it‚Äôs broken inside. This is a problem because my children help me load the dishwasher and start it, and they are not as good at handling eight tiny pieces of detergent versus one lump of detergent.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"These are not my favorite dishwasher pods, but on Amazon Prime Day this box was less than $10, which was a great value for the amount in the box. I prefer the Cascade dishwasher pods with the liquid and powder. The Finish pods seem to leave powder residue on some of the dishes, like it doesn‚Äôt disintegrate all the way. I use a finishing liquid in the dishwasher door too (hard water where I am). Also, if the pod is broken already and you still use it, it will not come out of the door in the wash. It Becomes a thick mat of powder in the holder.They‚Äôre also individually wrapped which is a bit annoying and seems wasteful, but you couldn‚Äôt have these pods in a box without wrapper. They‚Äôd fall apart.Overall, I‚Äôm okay with them and will continue to use the box I bought. I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll buy again.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

Most tablets where broken in package,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I have used this product for years, so it was great to find it on Amazon for a good price.  The negative is that the box looked like it had fallen off a truck, and some of the packets were a bit crumbled.  Seems like a quality control reject box.  It still works well, but some of the packets are broken into several pieces instead of one solid piece.  It means you need to be careful not to spill any broken pieces when you open them and put them in the dishwasher compartment.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I am disappointed in this product.  It is leaving more spots on my dishes than the cheaper brand i was using before.  Half of the packets are broken into powder.  They should be compressed into a solid block.  Still works, but messier to use.  I doubt i will purchase Finish again.  Sorry.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
I haven‚Äôt used dish washer in years so consider my perspective. I have always washed my dishes by hand with Dawn! Even with me rinsing the dishes before putting them into the dish washer they are frequently less clean after washing with Finish than hand washing with dawn! I also need to put dish on old fashion wooden rack to dry! They are always wet at the end of washing. I understand that need to buy separate Finish product to get dry dishes! I have a brand new GE dishwasher specifying use of Finish!I‚Äôm not impressed by Finish as dish cleaning product. I now soak pan and cooking dishes in hot water with Dawn added and then hand wash them instead of putting into dishwasher! Not impressed by Finish!,neutral,dishwashing tablet

These tablets work fine generally. I do use a rinse aid along with these and the dishes tend to come out OK. One gripe i do have is that the tablets have a tendency to get smashed in the box.

"To use, you have to open a foil packet. At least half of the tablets are powdered and crumbling. I often find white residue in pans and glasses.

Finish Quantuum does a better job, but I'm switching brands.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
Description did not mention that tablets were wrapped in foil packages. So every time you open one you have waste and end up touching the tablet. Will not buy this again.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"About half the dishwasher tabs have crumbled inside the foil package and little red ball in the top middle has come loose.

"I used this whole box before switching to another brand. What a difference with the new pods. These barely cleaned the dishes and unwrapping the foil caused a mess. Dust would get on the counter and little pieces of foil would stick to my fingers. Others have said this was either fake or old, but I won't be taking that chance again with Finish. I would have stopped using them earlier, but I thought the cleaning problem was with the dishwasher.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

However, I won‚Äôt be buying this bulk box anymore.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"Received the box of tabs but have not been as pleased with the results as I would have expected based on the reviews I read. It cleans my dishes adequately and as expected, however, it leaves what feels almost like a film of dust on the dishes that have forced me to rinse off my dishes again after having run the dishwasher and just letting them air dry in the dishwasher. This has not occurred previously (having recently used a dishwasher cleaner and powder dish detergent in the dispenser several uses prior to these), so I can only surmise that this product is the culprit. Will likely try a different brand and/or product after this disappointing experience.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

"We bought because the product was on sale.

"They stick together (because of course your hands are always wet when you go to grab them), they are expensive as he** (all brands) and have no idea WHY, and they all smell like a chemical bomb.

"So I know that the delivery of a product shouldn't affect my review on the actual product too much, but it did bring something to light. I've ordered two types of dish detergents on subscribe and save - this one and the finish branded ones. I don't have a preference, I cook dinner every night so I rarely do the dishes and when I do, I'm loading the dishwasher. As long as the dishes are clean and not streaky or hazy - what do I care?But then I received my subscribe and save delivery of this brand - the box was broken and all the pods were scattered all over the place, crushed. Then I realized how convenient it is that the Finish branded ones are individually wrapped. It helps with delivery, it adds an extra layer of protection to the tab, you don't need to worry about humidity, etc.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

This product is great‚Äîbut designed for hard water. It completely destroyed my flatware (because it has a type of citric acid in it) and etched all of my glassware.

The packets stick together. One recently broke open and spilled down my white kitchen cabinets. The only thing I was able to do was scrape it off with my fingernail. Nothing worked to wash it off.

"It works okay, but for best performance in my old dishwasher it does not do well alone. I need to use a rinse aid and liquid detergent at the same time as one of these to get my dishes clean.

So, now, I have to hand scrub the cup interiors before loading in the dishwasher, which is a royal PITA.Seventh Generation should just scrap these, and sell only the Ultra Power Plus, which is a fantastic product, and works as well as any of the chlorinated brands, without the chlorine and overwhelming perfumes. These don't.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
My only criticism is that they are too hard - literally. The result is that over time some have hardened into a shape that makes them difficult to insert in the soap dispenser in my dishwasher.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I've used a conventional brand for years, but I wanted to try a more eco-friendly product.  This cleaned my dishes beautifully for the first few weeks. Then, I started noticing my dishes were smelling really bad. I generally rinse my dishes before placing in the dishwasher, and scrub any oil or fats off with dish soap as well. However, I was getting a lot of build-up at the bottom of my dishwasher's filter area. I was literally cleaning the filter daily, and re-washing my dishes frequently. Therefore, I decided to go back to my conventional brand.If the company would add a better de-greaser to these tabs, I believe they would have an awesome product.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

Palmolive worked fine in our dishwasher. We frequently pre-rinse and use the steam option in the dishwasher cycle. We use one pod in the regular soap dispenser and one in the pre-wash dispenser. Our only disappointment was that the gel dried up for all of the pods suddenly when we were only half-way through the bag. hmm.,neutral,dishwashing tablet
The green gel in just about every individual soap pod leaked into the bag or was non existent. It‚Äôs like most any other. I like Palmolive but I‚Äôll switch to the dishwasher gel instead. These packs are cheaply made and not very good in my opinion.,neutral,dishwashing tablet

"These detergent pods do a good job at what they are supposed to do which is clean.I like that there is a combination of both powder and liquid soap. I have used detergent pods that are only powder and I always found myself adding a little bit of liquid soap to the dishwasher. With these pods I no longer need to do that, it really helps with the first clean/rinse cycle.Even though the Palmolive detergent pods are good, I think they are over-priced.  For the same amount of money (or even less) than these cost, I can get almost double the amount of detergent pods with other name brand detergents.",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I mean, pretty much universally everyone likes the cascade platinum plus pods.  I see no reason to switch brands unless a competitor is a lot better or a lot cheaper, this one is neither.

Part of being eco friendly is not wasting water. These tabs don't clean my dishes unless I put my dishes into the dishwasher already clean. I shouldn't have to wash my dishes in order to wash my dishes.

"We only use ""natural-ish"" dishwasher detergent because the conventional brands stink up the whole dishwasher area so much (not to mention the harsh detergents + possibility of health issues and asthma link in a house with children). We've had mixed results with other brands but gave this one a try. I will say it works reasonably well but the smell kills it for me. There is definitely a synthetic sickly ""fresh"" fragrance (nowhere near the advertised citrus smell) added and you can not only smell it in the dishwasher, but on the dishes themselves and it really lingers on anything silicone.

"I was skeptical about using ""environmentally friendly"" dish detergent, but having finally moved into my own house and getting to make my own household rules, my goal is harm reduction. So I spent a little (okay, maybe a lot) more and tried these.It works very well, I was very pleasantly surprised by how perfectly clean it gets the dishes I'm not even cleaning before I put them in the dishwasher, from a house I just inherited from a 91 year old woman, many with years of sticky grime and dirt after being in the cupboards unused for many years. I'm impressed.What doesn't impress me is what creating a plastic container for each pod that most won't recycle (many of us have no access to the facilities even) does to the environent; the pollution and materials in the process of making each little pouch, the waste in landfills, even the water and energy and manpower wasted in the process of recycling them.

"Honestly, as soon as I opened the box and saw that each tablet was wrapped in plastic I was so disappointed. Despite the ‚Äú94% recycled cardboard‚Äù box touting ‚Äúplant based & mineral ingredients‚Äù and ‚Äúbiodegradable formula‚Äù, not a single ingredient on the back sounds natural except for water. And wouldn‚Äôt all dish tablets be a ‚Äúbiodegradable formula [that] breaks down in waterways‚Äù, since they all breakdown in the dishwasher?But back to my main issue, wrapping the tablets in plastic. Sure each tablet indicates that the plastic is recyclable, but recycling a piece of place that plastic that small seems about as impactful as recycling a foil Hershey‚Äôs Kiss wrapper. My small-town apartment complex doesn‚Äôt have recycling, so I try to do what I can otherwise like buying compostable trash bags, buying paper packed laundry/dish/hand soap tablets, and when I forget to bring my reusable grocery bags I return the plastic ones to the store for recycling.Moral of the story, I feel like I‚Äôve purchased a less effective product in an effort to be more sustainable when the only for it to have more plastic than the Blueland products I‚Äôve been using.",neutral,dishwashing tablet

The ones from Costco don‚Äôt come in a wrapper and I prefer it that way, easier and less waste. But it‚Äôs otherwise my preferred brand of dishwasher detergent.",positive,dishwashing tablet
My dishes & acrylic glasses clean up really nice & don't leave a residue behind. I've used this product for years & have never had any problems.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I bought this thinking it was plastic free (silly me), but every pod is wrapped in plastic. It was the main reason I bought them, so back to the drawing board. They work as well as anything else though.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Although this is effective in the dishwasher on cleaning it is difficult  to get each packet open. I had to open each packet with scissors.,positive,dishwashing tablet
this is really a good value. i don't like any fragrance but its ok.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Cleans dishes great,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These dishwasher detergent packets are easy to use and then smell great without being overly chemical smelling. I am very sensitive to various chemical smells, but this has never bothered me. Although the individually wrapped ones within biodegradable plastic that you don‚Äôt have to open a more convenient, I prefer these cheaper ones even though you have to open the foil wrapper and throw it away",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Cleans dishes really well, easy to use and very affordable!",positive,dishwashing tablet
I love the performance - cleans dishes well but they recently changed the silver material that encases the tabs.  The old material could easily be torn with wet hands - the new one is impossible so I have to dry my hands and find scissors to open.  I have used this for a long time but will be changing brands now.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I just think it‚Äôs really convenient,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Love this product however, any tablets arrive broken because the boxes are unwrapped when they arrieve.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"It really cleans well, but leaves too much smell in the dishwasher",positive,dishwashing tablet
"seems to work okay, but taking the foil off is tedious.  but, of course, the competitor sticks together in the storage bin, doesn't it?",positive,dishwashing tablet
I don‚Äôt think the individual bags are necessary,positive,dishwashing tablet
"THE BOX WAS SMASHED, BUT THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL... PRODUCT IS FINE.",positive,dishwashing tablet
They work and got the job done. The issue I didn't think about was. We sometimes do not full loads and you don't have a choice to cut down the amount used as a liquid.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love this product but the packaging is very annoying. It‚Äôs not easy to open with wet hands at all. Although I do appreciate each tablet being wrapped individually that way if you grab it with wet hands it doesn‚Äôt accidentally activate when you‚Äôre not using. It started to clean up a lot of our dishes that were foggy. But it doesn‚Äôt really have any smell. I missed the fresh smell when he first open the dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product,positive,dishwashing tablet
They seem to work well but the individual wrapping it difficult to open. I am still deciding whether the trouble is worth it. I‚Äôm leaning towards paying a little extra for pods.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Product works good, smells great.  The only thing I don't like is having to take the plastic wrap off each pod before use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I need to remember to cancel this item. Works fine but hate the foil package.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Although I understand why this product is in plastic wrap, getting the individual packages open isn't easy. And then, there is the wasted wrapping. As for the product,  it works very well in our area. After use, the dishwasher is even cleaner (with a stainless steel tub).",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Dishwasher, I put the tab on the bottom of the washer",positive,dishwashing tablet
The package is so big that by the time I got to the bottom they feel like the took on moisture. They still work and I will buy again.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The only drawback is the foil wrapper.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Dishes in my home are rinsed and fairly clear before being put in the dishwasher, and they are not sitting for a long period of time. With this dish detergent, I have to use two of them to get the dishes clean. It also sometimes leaves a white residue on a few things (which I can just rinse off, but still.) I got a pack that had each little square individually wrapped, and I understand the concept behind that, but it‚Äôs rather annoying to me. I would buy again if I had to, but this wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I had been using the cascade pacs for awhile but I ran out and decided to try something else. I tried the Finish Gelpacks and these. The Gelpacks were terrible, they left a good amount of residue on the dishes after a cycle (never had that with cascade). These at least got the dishes clean, but left watermarks on everything (cascade never did). So I ended up buying the finish rinse solution to put in my machine (never needed a rinse aid with cascade‚Äîrhyming is completely unintentional). So from now on it‚Äôs cascade only. Glad I tried others though.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Cleans well but hard to open for an arthritic person,positive,dishwashing tablet
These are individually wrapped in the box and that kills my soul. Wont order again cause my weak hands cannot open them lol. My kids have to do it.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Not as good as I thought.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"PROS:Works in my BOSCH dishwasher. I put it in the little plastic door on the metal door.Works on less-water dishwasher setting (Opti-miser)Works on cat foodCONS:Hard to find at TargetComes individually wrapped. This isn't necessary and a huge waste! I would pay extra to have it packaged with less plastic.P.s. I have not been paid to write this, I just want to write more reviews this year because I read other peoples' reviews a lot, and I want to contribute something too :)",positive,dishwashing tablet
The Finish All in One really does a nice job of cleaning the dishes..because of the built in her dry there are no dried water spots and the dishes get completely dry! The only complaint I have is the wrapping of each pod‚Ä¶wish it came with no wrapping.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product.  Clean the dishes well in my Bosch dishwasher,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I had to find a new detergent because Cascade stopped getting my dishes clean. It is the oddest phenomenon how dish washing detergent will just stop cleaning. No, I don't need to clean the dishwasher, it is only a few months old.  Regardless, I switched to Finish and so far, it is cleaning the dishes without leaving spots or food on the anything. So, this is my ""go to"" brand for now. I also like that none of the pods have stuck together, which was an issue with Cascade if it wasn't used quickly.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"So the individual pods come in their own individual wrapper. I guess this is good so that is the box gets wet, the pods won‚Äôt go bad but it‚Äôs a pain every time to open each pod to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These cleaners work, simple and effective.. just more effort to peel the foil from the package as Opposed to the drop and go tape‚Ä¶ But they last forever and there areLots of them",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These work well, but I am a bit disappointed that the tabs are all individually wrapped.  I didn't pay attention to that detail.  I realize why, because they are compressed powder, even the powerball.  They are NOT the Finish Quantum that is also pictured for this product.  I bought a year's supply because they were on special, so at least they clean well.  I do wish there was a way to minimize the individual wrappers.  I wonder if I can recycle them.  I put them in a big clear glass jar on my counter above my dshwasher, so they do look sparkly and decorative in my kitchen.  Probably not the look the manufacturer thought of, but I figured I would make the best of my oversight.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Love finish for my dishwasher. Been using it for years. This was a larger package and a very good price. Unless price goes up too much I will be buying again. Have it set up to buy every couple months.12/19 someone asked about tablets being broken earlier & I  said I  never had this experience. This last box I opened a week or so ago it seems every 2nd or 3rd one I take out is broken. It's a bigger box than I've ever bought more room to bounce around I suppose but this has never happened before. Not pleased with this but use them and they still clean but would rather them be in 1 piece.. took 1 star off. Will add back if next box aren't broken up.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Works great, tried washing with out it. Dishes wasn't that clean, still had food on it. After using this Dishes came out clean..",positive,dishwashing tablet
The product is great- works perfectly. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that each tablet is individually wrapped. Awful packaging  - so wasteful.,positive,dishwashing tablet
My only complaint if there isn‚Äôt a reason these can‚Äôt be open in the container. They are all individually wrapped and so wasteful and an extra step from container to dishwasher.Also sometimes they don‚Äôt fully dissolve but isn‚Äôt a huge issue most the time.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"This is the only detergent my dishwasher will use. Each pod is individually wrapped. This can be a godsend or pain in the butt. The pro to having them individually wrapped is that they don‚Äôt all become sticky and come together, but the con is that you have to unwrap one every time you need to start a load. I also which it came in a more durable container. I dumped them into a big plastic tub so the flattened box that it came in wouldn‚Äôt continue to split them everywhere.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall a great product, but once again, Packaging problem. The package was smashed a bit at the top, and some of the pods had come out. Not a huge deal since they're individually wrapped, but some of them when I open them are crumbly. Considering the price for these things, that's a bit irritating at the very least. Plus, don't like to get that stuff on my hands, as they're filled with caustic chemicals.Just always strikes me a little bit sad to have a really good product, only to leave a negative mark on the experience because of laziness in the packaging process.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Product works great, especially in a stainless DW. Really made interior look like new after two years of using liquid paste product.My beef is somewhat of a MINOR  one as these individual tablets are wrapped in foil, come in a light cardboard box,  and need to be opened first and placed in soap compartment.Other Finish tabs are wrapped in dissolvable plastic and go right in soap compartment without contact of soap ingredients of tablet.It‚Äôs true that if you get wetness inside of the plastic tablet container of dissolving tabs, you might create a sticky mess ( dry hands only) but I think I prefer the dissolvable ones better.Easier to work with. üòÄAlso...don‚Äôt use additional liquid ‚Äúspot remover‚Äù in DW as you may upset the balance of the provided red ‚Äúspot remover‚Äù of tablet.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall these are decent dishwasher detergent tablets. Some of the tablets come broken and the red center is detached from the tablet portion. The price is good, but I don't feel like this soap cleans my dishes as well as other brands.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Well! Let me first say that this is my favorite dishwasher detergent brand. I was super happy to see that I could get a giant box of this stuff on Amazon. I WILL admit that what I received surprised me when I opened the little washer packet, mostly because I thought from the picture that this was the kind that had the gel layer. These are the ones that are the solid (powdered) detergent. This means I likely won‚Äôt get this box of them again, because I do prefer the ones that have the combination solid and gel layer. I think those do the best job and seem to work better with my dishwasher. However, these are also good, so they will definitely be used, and I will look around on Amazon to see if I can find a big box of the others that I prefer.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I didn't realize that each tablet needs to be unwrapped before use.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Product is great only drawback is this is the one you have to open each one verus the finsh with the self disolving wrapper.  Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.  ( more my fault for orderingthe wrong one),positive,dishwashing tablet
My only complaint is that the tablets come in an individual foil wrapper which you have to peel off and dispose of.  I wish they came in a clear plastic dissolvable package.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Some of the reviewed here complained about damage to the pods.  I risked it and figured that I was reasonably close to a distribution hub and it would not be a problem.  The actual problem is that the box was shipped in a vinyl envelope only.  No real protection.  The product box came with rounded corners from being bounced around and about 20% of the pods were either broken to dust or cracked.  Not enough to return but enough to buy my next batch at my local big box store.The pods themselves are very good.  Easy to use, and cleans my dishes well.  No complaints.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"So far so good!Hope it will change to not individual package of each cube, reduce the waste.",positive,dishwashing tablet
This product is suprising me a lot.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great,positive,dishwashing tablet
Honest review here.I found this to be good value for the price.  I usually prefer the liquid pods but these dissolved well and worked great.  There was never any weird residue left in the dishwasher from the solids which is great.I would definitely buy again!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I opened these about five days ago. I am visually impaired and I opened the box and placed one tablet in dishwasher and ran it. Today five days later my granddaughter, 11, asked what all the silver things were in the dishwasher. She got them out. So my dishes were not being washed. So I tried to open one to put in dishwasher and I could not open so I had to poke it with a sharp meatfork. I don't like these.  They seem old, old fashioned and hard. Nothing like the last Finish I bought in March and loved.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This dishwashing soap works better than anything we have found. It gets our dishes clean and only occasionally do we have to scrub a pan that doesn‚Äôt get the cooked on food off. I don‚Äôt have a problem with that. One complaint is that it removed the writing on our Pyrex measuring cup, so after replacing it we now wash that by hand. The only other complaint is that it eats aluminum. We had to throw out our aluminum ice cream scoop because the metal started stuffing off on our ice cream, so avoid putting anything aluminum in the dishwasher. To leave on a good note, it does make our copper pans shine without scrubbing and polishing.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Product does a great job. And is of good value. Just want to note that the packaging on this shipment was barely ok. I received it yesterday, Sunday......great service. The package was an Amazon envelope and product inside....Fine. But not not safe for being tossed or pushed into the mailbox by USPS. Amazon envelop was in good shape but should have been packed with something inside. The box popped open and most of the tablets were on the bottom of the bag. All seem undamaged, but not good packaging on this shipment. (All tabs are wrapped individuals.)",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I buy this brand because it smells less awful than the other brands. No longer do I need to wash my tea cup when it comes out of the dishwasher to get rid of the smell of the dishwasher detergent. But it seems to have a short shelf life, if you buy it more than about 6 months before using, the cakes just crumble when you open the packages. We often buy supplies ahead, and it doesn't work well for this product.BTW, it seems to do a great job cleaning dishes, but so do other brands that I have tried.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Works well, good value. Was shipped in an envelope instead of a box, so the cardboard box it came in was totally destroyed. They are hard pucks instead of gel packs, so they survived fine.Only complaint besides shipping is that each one is individually wrapped in plastic, which is both wasteful/bad for the environment, but also is just annoying to have to open every time with wet hands after doing dishes. (although with the poor shipping method, this actually worked out well for me this time).",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall I like the product. I rated this 4 stars now as the new box I received has many broken tablets so I have to open the packages over the dish washer. In addition, I am not a fan of the individually wrapped tablets as I do not think it is environmentally safe, but luckily they are individually wrapped otherwise the box would have been a powder mess. I just hope in the future the packaging is of better quality or I might have to choose a different one.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This product itself is good,  however if you go to Costco and buy a tub of these pucks,  they come in easy to use pucks that dissolve, there is no plastic to remove or dispose of.  This seems to be the older product that requires you to tear open a mylar wrapper and dispose of it.  This creates unnecessary plastic landfill that the more modern Finish product doesnt use.  So on this point, this product has been improved since and I wouldnt buy the Finish product in this box or packaging again.  Only buy the Finish that is in the fully dissolvable pucks going forward.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Met expectations,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Dishes, glasses and silverware are always super clean in our Bosch dishwasher.  Best pricing we found on these tabs.  Little foil wrapping is hard to grip and open.  Too many of the tabs are broken inside their wrapping, not sure if that's from rough handling during shipping.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This is the brand I always use, and normally purchase it from Costco. I wanted to add it to my subscribe and save so I got it through Amazon. The product works just fine, however, I‚Äôm disappointed because each pod is individually wrapped unlike the pods I normally purchase from the store.  Needless to say I won‚Äôt be ordering this again!  Unwrapping each pod is not only annoying but it‚Äôs also environmentally unfriendly.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These clean well but I think I received some old ones.  The product is a pressed powdered detergent cube in an aluminum type wrapper.  They have to be unwrapped before using and most of them are dried out and dissolve into powder in my hands while unwrapping occasionally.  I never had this problem with another box I bought at a supermarket.  I will  buy the gel ones from now on from another brand.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I would like to give this product a 5 star out of 5 but since I have to purchase another product to keep my glassware steak free not happy bout it. It should have been added to this product as an upgrade and not an option. I‚Äôm pretty sure every consumer would love to use all their glassware clear and shiny as advertised.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The packets are not the easiest to open and several have been busted already when went to open so that made for more cleanup. But as far as cleaning your dishes these do really good and have very little spotting(water spots) left on dishes,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The headline says it all and this is why I'm giving the product 4 stars.  These tablets work well but during shipping, many are broken up, so you have pieces and grains that are almost impossible to use.  In fact, I've thrown a few away.  I don't know the solution - maybe better packing.  All I know is that about 10 percent of these are useless.  But the other 90 percent are greaet.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"The functionality is good but the packaging is lacking.  The box was broken, the pads were spilled out, and many were broken inside the individual wrappers.  I don't love that they are each wrapped since it is just another bit of trash to occupy the landfills; however, with the soft nature of the tablets and the rough transit, the wrappers allowed many crushed ones to still be used.  I will probably try something else next time.",positive,dishwashing tablet
It works good,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Okay, so as im sure people going through reviews have seen this product does have some issues sometimes. Some of the packages arent perfect and sometimes you do get a dud and have to rewash. Now let me ask you, how much do you pay for these somewhere else? Certainly not 15 bucks for 94 of them. Its more like 12 for 34 or something like that. For all the new people, its worth it. Even if they are broken, put them in there - they dissolve and work great. The product doesnt have to be perfect to work. Will buy again.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"When I couldn't get this product about 2 months ago, I ordered the orange gelpaks. Noticed, recently, that glasses in my dishwasher came out with a yellowish/orange cast. Clearly, there was some residue left on utensils, etc. in the dishwasher. Ordered the Finish powerball product when it became available through Amazon. Not well packaged; about 8 or 10 of the pods were open, broken or damaged. The pods work well; but buying something with a 10% or greater defect rate is not my idea of quality packaging.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Love the BULK package of this near-daily used product.  Cleans dishes spotless in my Bosch DW's 1HR cycle.  But as we all know ... it's all about HOW you LOAD the DW.  Bosch provides detailed instructions for loading which I read and followed, but sadly, my wife hasn't.  As a result ‚Ä¶ I do the dishes in the family.My one pet peeve (minus one star):  Even though these tablets are individually-wrapped in space-age plastiluminum packages ‚Ä¶ over time I have noticed evidence of moisture-damage to the wrapped tablets.  Humidity sensitive?  I have no water leaks under the sink.  The packages are also a pain to unwrap and always result in only a slightly torn corner that require more manipulation to unpeel.  Ugh.  It should take no more than ONE PULL to free these tabs.  Cheap packaging.",positive,dishwashing tablet

Does the job.  Probably could find something less expensive and just as good‚Ä¶,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Finish Powerball works well in my dishwasher.  I subtracted 1 star because this batch isn't the same as my previous order, these are individually wrapped and must be taken out of the package to use.  The previous order came individually wrapped but could be put into dishwasher whole and the wrapper would dissolve, much more convenient.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I would have preferred to have purchased the pods that don't require opening an outer layer to remove the pod before placing into the dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great little dish-cleaning bricks!My ONLY disappointment is that each little brick is individually wrapped in foiled plastic.We know about how each of these things impact our planet, and should be better in making packaging choices.",positive,dishwashing tablet

I loved the price point for these. They are not the best ones out there but for the money they do the job.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I've seen quite a few people complaining about residue or broken tablets. So far, all of my tablets have been packaged correctly and intact. I also have only noticed residue one time, but I needed to clean out my dishwasher filter anyway. Your dishwasher may be sensitive to rinsing properly like mine if that needs changed. Apart from that one time, not residue left on dishes. It's not going to give you a shine like some of the more expensive detergents.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I have to re-do my review and take away a star. That is because more the half the box contained broken packets. While they still work fine, it's not what I paid for, and an added hassle to shake all the pieces into the holder. Otherwise, I have no complaints.",positive,dishwashing tablet
If there is food still in plates it doesn‚Äôt clean them off as well but if you rinse the food off they come out very clean,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Yes, these are powdery and crumbled.  They seem to be an ""outlet"" item.  I had no problem with them cleaning just as good, but using them is annoying.  They are definitely cheaper and more convenient via Amazon, but I did stop sub/save and started getting at my local Kroger because I do find them being in an actual tablet form a lot easier to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"The detergent tabs clean dishes well enough, but the box I received was missing about 10 tabs and several were unwrapped and broken making a mess in the box.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These are a great value. They clean great. Better than others in this price point per use. The only issue I have is after you get half way through the box the bottom ones are crushed. Not sure if this is a packaging issue or shipping issue. I am still able to use them. Just have to not spill the crumbs when opening. Would still buy again doesn't effect cleaning ability.,positive,dishwashing tablet

"They work great, just wish packaging could be made biodegradable.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I love this product- I found that this tab works best for my heavy loads! And I was excited about the save and subscribe price. These are the individually wrapped packs, which is an additional step. While I don‚Äôt love the extra waste in packaging, as a mom of small children it is nice to know that if one of these gets into the hands of my kids (don‚Äôt worry, I do store them out of reach, but you never know!) that they won‚Äôt be able to pop them in their mouth. Some, not many, of the tabs were broken when I opened them, but not so much so that it made it difficult to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This has happened again. I‚Äôve used only 5 pods from my new box and 1 package was empty, sealed and empty. Two more have been in large pieces. And now one of them is completely crushed into powder.",positive,dishwashing tablet

I didn‚Äôt realize these are individually wrapped.  Some of them are crushed when I open.  I have bought these before that were loose in a bag which I prefer.  I like this brand over other.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product but probably not for a family with young children. Packaging looks like a fun size candy bar. Could be enticing for little ones to try to open and eat.,positive,dishwashing tablet

"Some are broken, but they are in closed in a wrapper, so no foul.  Work great.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These seem to do a pretty good job of getting the dishes clean. Wish I had looked more closely though- all the tablets are individually packaged in plastic. Super wasteful and also adds a couple annoying seconds to unwrap it.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I have been purchasing these for years because they work well and are a good value. However, I have noticed the red power ball leaves a weird purplish streak at the bottom of the dishwasher where the door opens/closes. It's kind of hard to scrub off too.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These dishwasher tablets do the trick but I dislike the inconvenience of unwrapping every single tablet after loading the dishwasher. These wrappers generate a lot of waste so if you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint I would not recommend these.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Individual wrappings must be removed, a minor inconvenience. So far about one in five is broken inside sealed package. Seeing other reviews of broken product I wonder if these are factory QC rejects??Never had this problem with ‚Äúbrick and mortar‚Äù store bought pods.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"They do a great job cleaning my dishes, but I cringe every time I throw away the wrapper from the individually wrapped pods.  Had I known that all the pods were individually wrapped I wouldn't have purchased.  Very unnecessary packaging.  I would probably not buy again just for this reason.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This product works real well in our high-end dishwasher that processes naturally soft water. What I like about it is also what I hate about it: the wrapper. The packaging keeps the cake moisture-free, so it doesn't swell, as the other packets do, which causes them to lose their shape and interfere with the detergent-release door. At the same time, the wrapper is a bit of a hassle to remove, and it's yet another piece of junk heading into the waste stream.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"My only gripe is that these come wrapped in foil, which you have to unwrap. The last pack I bought had the hot water soluble coating, so that's what I expected here. Great tabs though!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great product, but a ton of waste. Each pod is individually wrapped within the package.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Wow. This is my first time using Finish for my dishwasher and it works wonderfully! It really scrubs the grime off of my dishes and it dries without leaving spots. I am pretty impressed with this little pod. One downside is that they are all individually wrapped and I feel that it's a bit wasteful so I'm taking a star away for that reason.,positive,dishwashing tablet

Good value.  Works well. Only complaint is the hard to open little packages - have to use scissors to cut them open.,positive,dishwashing tablet
It is a fine detergent in terms of cleaning capabilities but ever since moving from Cascade I've noticed a lot more water spots on my dishes. As a detergent it does exactly what it's supposed to do and removes some of the more baked-on stains from my dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
fits in soap dispenser...no measuring no problem,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I am sensitive to fragrances. It is getting more difficult to get scent-free dishwashing products that clean my dishes. And I hate the dissolving pods. Finish is scented, but each finish tablet is wrapped in foil, so I am only exposed to fragrance and fumes for the short time I unwrap the tablet, place it in its comparment, and close my dishwasher. There are no fumes during or after the washing cycle. Finish does a great cleaning job, even when I don't rinse my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Bought these by accident. Main downside is they are a compressed powder, in an individual mylar packet that has to be opened. Sometimes the red pellet is detached. Opening the package to get it out then put it in the cup means you have to handle it. Does a good job of cleaning the dishes but prefer the gel type that don't need to be opened.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Great product except that I find that they are more likely to not dissolve during the wash cycle compared to liquid pouches. Still relatively rare though and it could easily be my older dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The box is cardboard rather than the more durable plastic pail that some competitors use which leads to some broken tablets.Overall the dishes come out clean but sometimes a little spotty.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I got it on sale. Each tablet has a wrapper so it needs to be opened and discarded every time. Dishes come out clean though.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Love Finish products but they tend to short the packages. This 94 tab pack has 85 tabs. My previous purchase resulted in the same issues... and I call Finish every time. Count your tabs!!!!!!!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I like the product, but when it arrived the outside of the box (as well as other products in the the package) was covered in powder.  Inside the box of Finish every packet was covered in powder and there was at least one empty packet. The box itself felt as if it had been wet.  Will not likely order this particular product from Amazon again.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Great product and great price.,positive,dishwashing tablet
great value,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The product is great.  However, it was just thrown in an envelope and handed over to package abusers.  Product box was busted open and individual soap tablets busted out of their wrappings.  Whatever, most of the time they get it right, just not this time.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These work very well. We have hard water and these help the dishwasher power through the grease and food.But every Powerball is in a slippery plastic protective packet that you have to tear open (usually with wet hands) and it's not fun. Surely they could make the little packets less slippery. Put a ""tread"" on them or make them of a different material.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This brand and these pods work great. Only thing I don‚Äôt like it how they are all individually wrapped üò¨ The ones I bought previously had the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù on them that dissolved in the dishwasher. These don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs annoying.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Really like this one. Doesn‚Äôt leave a residue.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Some finish washer tablets come with each tab individually wrapped in a clear self dissolving wrapper.  Those are great and easy to use.  These come individually wrapped in plastic foil.  Not only does it take a few seconds to remove, but all of this bits of plastic are going into our landfill for no reason. I strongly recommend Finish dishwasher tablets, but advise you buy the ones that do not have the individual foil wrap.",positive,dishwashing tablet
dishwasher and I like the detergent very much but hate that you have to take off he silver wrapper because then you have to have contact with the pod and the other ones that you don't have to unwrap to put in dishwasher are better.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The pods stayed together unlike I read in other reviews. However the center red piece in the middle was missing in most pods, rejected batch? Sold directly from Amazon.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I intended to but the ones that come in a plastic coating that dissolves in the wash. These aren't them.  My fault, but not what I wanted.  That said, they clean really well, just like the other ones",positive,dishwashing tablet
Cleans very well. My only annoyance is the dumb little wrapper I have to remove,positive,dishwashing tablet
I originally bought this because using the water soluble gel packs weren't dissolving properly in my dishwasher. I don't get this problem as often now but it still happens every now and then.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Most of the capulets are dry and in pieces, makes me wonder how old this product was when sold. If you don't mind having pieces of the capulets all over your fingers, it does work",positive,dishwashing tablet
Love the product. But the box was opened when delivered & the pods were in the shipping bag.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These are my favorite dishwasher tabs. I‚Äôve tried tons of different powders, liquids, and tabs. These are my favorite. They get the dishes clean!",positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great. The only thing negative is that half of them were broken.,positive,dishwashing tablet
These really do seam to clean my dishes so they are ok .Thanks again .,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Received this product with the Amazon packaging intact but the product itself was opened,crushed and some of the pods we‚Äôre open. See pictures. Happy to have dishwasher pods but sketched out that the box was open and destroyed, hesitant to use them.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"It is a little annoying that each tab is individually wrapped, but otherwise great product.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I'm a long time user of Finish, which works for me; but in the last few packages I'm seeing more crumbled pieces.",positive,dishwashing tablet
It seems to work well. No streaks for the most part. I‚Äôve gone through a couple boxes and I‚Äôll keep on getting these.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Oh my God!  My dishes are so clean.  I wish I had used soap before.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Let's see...what did I like about this product? It does a great job ‚ÄºÔ∏è,positive,dishwashing tablet
I like the product but the original package was opened with tabs out of box. I like the product but will pay more elsewhere. Also there were not 94 tabs only 82,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Very easy to use, mess free, with stellar cleaning power.",positive,dishwashing tablet
The one thing that impressed me with these tablets is that they work very well even with the extremely hard well water I have to use.,positive,dishwashing tablet
It works as expected except some individual tablets are broken up into pieces.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I hate that they are individually wrapped. But great value.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"But I can‚Äôt stand the new packaging in the foil. I liked the resolvable plastic much more. Also, I‚Äôve noticed it leaves a faint residue sometimes which is annoying. I rinse some stuff with water afterwards to clean it off",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I did not experience the white residue that some other customers mention, and in fact my dishes had that feeling that gives meaning to the phrase ""squeaky clean"" when they came out.However, I was a bit disappointed that these come individually wrapped, in silver foil packets like mini-candy bars (thank providence I don't have children) which means you have to take an extra step, fumbling with the wrapper, and then also have waste.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"they come individual packs of dry cubes, some are so dry they are cracked or chipped and broken, but can still be used in the dishwasher, I would prefer the liquid next time",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I prefer the open each tab type of dish soap. The pod type leave behind the plastic residue. That can gum up the modern sensor (HE) dishwasher.Update: Amazon seems to beat up the package, the tabs are broken and some smashed.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These work great but why does the company spend extra money to individually wrap each one in plastic? It‚Äôs a pain to remove and I prefer the ones that come straight out of the box and go directly into the dishwasher!,positive,dishwashing tablet
They just don‚Äôt get everything clean all the time it‚Äôs a hit or miss,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I had purchased these years ago and then switched over to the gel-pack type.  I recently purchased them again.  No problem with the product performance but I recall now why I stopped buying them - the packaging.  Each tablet is individually wrapped in a foil packet which means you need to fiddle with the foil and then toss it away.  Otherwise, they work very well.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Washes dishes ok. But the tablets begin to deteriorate before I get them all used.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"They work well, but I don't love that they're all individually packed. Seems like an unnecessary and not eco friendly step.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These tabs were better than what I had been using and these get the glasses very clean .  Does a nice job on the dishes too.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Bought this because it was what the manufacturer of my new dishwasher recommended. It really worked much better than the gel stuff I had been buying from the grocery store. I will be buying this again.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Nothing special but the size is very convenient.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Seems to work pretty well. Don‚Äôt love the individual packaging but first world problems.,positive,dishwashing tablet
These things work great and are a decent price but the tabs are all individually wrapped which seems like such an unnecessary/wasteful step. Otherwise I‚Äôd give them 5 stars.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Did not realize each packet is individually wrapped,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love the product but inevitably so many of the blocks of detergent are broken that I end up getting about 80/94 tablets use.,positive,dishwashing tablet
It‚Äôs all good,positive,dishwashing tablet
They do the job!,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love the product great for dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"They are individually wrapped. Not crazy about the extra waste. They are cleaning very good. No left over detergent pods, no mess, no residue, and clean sent.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"My wife and I switched to these on the recommendation of our dishwasher repair guy and have been very happy with them. These leave us with clean dishes, no residue and our dish washer doesn't start smelling over time.To be perfectly fair we do use a dish washer cleaner every month but we have been very happy with Finish after trying nearly every other brand.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I hate that I got the ones that are individually wrapped, and you have to open each individual one to use",positive,dishwashing tablet
"They clean well, but leave white stains on some items which forces me to have to re-wash those items by hand.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Not bad but leaves film on dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
These tabs are a bit different then the ones I expected to receive.  My last mega order I received tabs that did not come in a wrapped foil packet - these do.  It's a bit of an extra step and wasteful.  However I still enjoy the product and it cleans my dishes well.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Okay,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great Value, It‚Äôs great not having to pick up at grocery store every few weeks.  My only problem is that they get dried out before I get through them. I use one a day, unless I have company.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Took awhile to get by the time I got them the store had them back in stock but now i have extra,positive,dishwashing tablet
More for money,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These are not as good as the packets with liquid in them, but much better than the box of powder. And, I love having them shipped to my house.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Do not buy if you have CHILDREN who steal candy, these look like bite size CANDY BARS. And before Corporate says they don't they may not look like chocolate outside of the wrapper but the detergent looks like hard sugar candy like Sweet Tarts, The wrapper is a foil like 3 Musketeers or Milky Way. Other than Finish trying to finish our children, these work very well",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This is my go to dishwasher pods for effectiveness and cost efficiency! I love ‚Äú that other C brand‚Äù but for the money, this one rules!",positive,dishwashing tablet
Individual wrapping to should be good around children.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great but each one is individually wrapped. More trash for the land fill.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall, this cleans your dish. However it leaves the dishes dusty. In addition, each tablet is covered in a plastic film. I won‚Äôt buy this version again.",positive,dishwashing tablet
The box inside the packing bag was open.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Individually wrapped which seems like a waste and a bother.  Otherwise they work well.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Older dishwasher. I don‚Äôt rince before hand and everything still comes out clean and shiny.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"They work well and are priced right but the Cascade ones seem to work better in my machine. My extensive research reveals spots on the glasses which my mother in law then complained about. I don't really care about her opinion but to be fair, she was right. They did have spots which they did not with the Cascade brand.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Dishes get clean but not the dissolvable packaging I‚Äôve purchased from this brand in the past. These are individual foil wrapped tablets that have to be opened.,positive,dishwashing tablet
This works really well in my dishwasher,positive,dishwashing tablet
Great dishwashing soap,positive,dishwashing tablet
Drives me nuts that these are individually wrapped.  Work well otherwise.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Sometimes they crumble before even getting them into the dishwasher. I think the Cascade Platinum pods might be better.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Box said 94 tabs.  I counted three times and received only 84 tabs.  Disappointed!,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product. Arrived in a very rough condition. See pics. Tablets intact and useable. This was shipped inside another box -- go figure?,positive,dishwashing tablet
I am satisfied with this product but where's the dawn ultra 2 pack that I ordered with it?,positive,dishwashing tablet
Why tho. That‚Äôs it. Otherwise good purchase! ü•¥,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love these! I took off one star because I prefer the ones that I don‚Äôt have to unwrap before using. These are individuals wrapped.,positive,dishwashing tablet
A good buy with 94 ct.,positive,dishwashing tablet
These sucked in my apartment dishwasher. Now I own a home and have a newer dishwasher. Still getting some residue but no longer any leftover junk. Still looking for one that doesn't leave residue,positive,dishwashing tablet

These have worked nicely.  I was surprised I usually use the liquid pods but would buy these again,positive,dishwashing tablet

works great and no mess,positive,dishwashing tablet
Lavaplatos,positive,dishwashing tablet
You might have to work a slightly smaller load to make sure everything gets clean. But that may also be our dishwasher. Everything works just fine and these keep forever.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Very easy to use. Does get the dishes clean but not dry even with a heated dry. Although I love the ease it‚Äôs not very environmentally friendly,positive,dishwashing tablet
Dishes are sparkling clean!?,positive,dishwashing tablet
Does the job,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great price. I prefer using gel packs, but these solid blocks work pretty well. I've had a couple instances where the block didn't fully dissolve, but that could just be an issue with my dishwasher.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Packaging  inconvenient !,positive,dishwashing tablet
A few of the pods were out of the package,positive,dishwashing tablet
It's the same dishwasher detergent you buy at the grocer.  Only difference is the red ball part is broken in every individual pack and you have to fish it out and put it in the dishwasher compartment if you want to use it.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Looks and works just like the current version of the brand on the shelf at the store. The store-bought tablets are wrapped in a very thin bit of plastic, which you don't remove. I had to warn my son: You can't put these tablets in the dishwasher without removing the wrapper. He rolled his eyes. I also bought the Finish Dishwasher Cleaner, and Jet Dry Rinse Aid. Our dishwasher repair man recommended them, along with running the dishwasher with both, on a hot water and heat dry cycle. Even using the dishwasher once a day, you should see what can grow in the filter, and along the inside of the door at the bottom of the dishwasher.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Love these but hate how they are each individually wrapped. Waste of plastic.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Cleans as well as powder and better than liquid!,positive,dishwashing tablet
Product seems to tackle tough food residue.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I like the product and it does it‚Äôs job. I dislike the fact that the tablets are encased and you have to open it up before you can use it. Why not encase them in a dissolving encasement if they have to be encased.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These seem to work best in our dishwasher. They are individually wrapped, probably to protect from wet hands.",positive,dishwashing tablet
This Finish All In One Powerball detergent works better than Cascade for me. I have a relatively new Bosch dishwater and fairly hard water. Neither detergent works well without the rinse aid filled.,positive,dishwashing tablet

Most have been crumbled inside of their individual wrappings. They still work great!,positive,dishwashing tablet

"Finish all in one ""Deep Clean"" Tabs  come in aluminum wrappers and easy to open and drop in to the dispenser. Be careful to buy only the the Tabs that are labeled DEEP CLean on the box. They work really well and won't clog your drain line. The tabs when opened can drop a few soap pieces but is not messy.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Great product...Great price.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The price is great but the fact that each pod comes individually packaged in a foil wrapper is irritating and a waste of time. Works great though!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"It's a good value - I don't really have much of a preference for dishwasher detergent between this and cascade, they both seem to work just fine.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I have always been a fan of Finish over Cascade.  I highly recommend using Powerball and not Quantum. I‚Äôve used both a number of times and Powerball is absolutely better at cleaning dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These work great, but are individually packaged and require a scissor to open.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product - Good value.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I bought this brand at a good price. It cleans well. I don't care for the exta step of unwrapping the tablet. I prefer the ready to use drop ins.,positive,dishwashing tablet

"This purchase will probably last us  until we are ""in the home""...",positive,dishwashing tablet
The detergent clean prefect and with no traces also in glasses. I did t give 5 stars because each capsule  individual stairs and I find that a waste. Sure there‚Äôs a reason for that but I prefer to save resources,positive,dishwashing tablet
"As many says the soap cleans well. Leaves water mark on some surfaces without jet dry but I‚Äôm totally cool with that.I‚Äôve previously bought Finish All from Costco. That one comes in water-soluble individual packaging so all you have to do is to make sure your hands dry before reaching into the container.With this product from Amazon you‚Äôre saving a few cents, but having to tear open plastic packaging every night, be very careful not to spill the powder, and risk getting a broken soap in the first place. not worth the waste or effort.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I always order this product and like it but cannot understand why it did not come in a shipping box.  Just had my address label stuck on.  Finish can break apart very easily so it should be boxed with the proper cushioning to prevent breakage.  Hence, the ""4"" stars.",positive,dishwashing tablet

Cleans dishes great,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These dishwasher detergent packets are easy to use and then smell great without being overly chemical smelling. I am very sensitive to various chemical smells, but this has never bothered me.

"Cleans dishes really well, easy to use and very affordable!",positive,dishwashing tablet
I love the performance - cleans dishes well but they recently changed the silver material that encases the tabs.  The old material could easily be torn with wet hands - the new one is impossible so I have to dry my hands and find scissors to open.

I don‚Äôt think the individual bags are necessary,positive,dishwashing tablet
"THE BOX WAS SMASHED, BUT THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL... PRODUCT IS FINE.",positive,dishwashing tablet
They work and got the job done. The issue I didn't think about was. We sometimes do not full loads and you don't have a choice to cut down the amount used as a liquid.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love this product but the packaging is very annoying. It‚Äôs not easy to open with wet hands at all. Although I do appreciate each tablet being wrapped individually that way if you grab it with wet hands it doesn‚Äôt accidentally activate when you‚Äôre not using. It started to clean up a lot of our dishes that were foggy. But it doesn‚Äôt really have any smell. I missed the fresh smell when he first open the dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet

They seem to work well but the individual wrapping it difficult to open. I am still deciding whether the trouble is worth it. I‚Äôm leaning towards paying a little extra for pods.,positive,dishwashing tablet

I need to remember to cancel this item. Works fine but hate the foil package.,positive,dishwashing tablet

The only drawback is the foil wrapper.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Dishes in my home are rinsed and fairly clear before being put in the dishwasher, and they are not sitting for a long period of time. With this dish detergent, I have to use two of them to get the dishes clean. It also sometimes leaves a white residue on a few things (which I can just rinse off, but still.) I got a pack that had each little square individually wrapped, and I understand the concept behind that, but it‚Äôs rather annoying to me. I would buy again if I had to, but this wouldn‚Äôt be my first choice!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I had been using the cascade pacs for awhile but I ran out and decided to try something else. I tried the Finish Gelpacks and these. The Gelpacks were terrible, they left a good amount of residue on the dishes after a cycle (never had that with cascade). These at least got the dishes clean, but left watermarks on everything (cascade never did). So I ended up buying the finish rinse solution to put in my machine (never needed a rinse aid with cascade‚Äîrhyming is completely unintentional). So from now on it‚Äôs cascade only. Glad I tried others though.",positive,dishwashing tablet

I have not been paid to write this, I just want to write more reviews this year because I read other peoples' reviews a lot, and I want to contribute something too :)",positive,dishwashing tablet
The Finish All in One really does a nice job of cleaning the dishes..because of the built in her dry there are no dried water spots and the dishes get completely dry! The only complaint I have is the wrapping of each pod‚Ä¶wish it came with no wrapping.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product.  Clean the dishes well in my Bosch dishwasher,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I had to find a new detergent because Cascade stopped getting my dishes clean. It is the oddest phenomenon how dish washing detergent will just stop cleaning. No, I don't need to clean the dishwasher, it is only a few months old.  Regardless, I switched to Finish and so far, it is cleaning the dishes without leaving spots or food on the anything. So, this is my ""go to"" brand for now. I also like that none of the pods have stuck together, which was an issue with Cascade if it wasn't used quickly.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"So the individual pods come in their own individual wrapper. I guess this is good so that is the box gets wet, the pods won‚Äôt go bad but it‚Äôs a pain every time to open each pod to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These cleaners work, simple and effective.. just more effort to peel the foil from the package as Opposed to the drop and go tape‚Ä¶ But they last forever and there areLots of them",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These work well, but I am a bit disappointed that the tabs are all individually wrapped.  I didn't pay attention to that detail.  I realize why, because they are compressed powder, even the powerball.  They are NOT the Finish Quantum that is also pictured for this product.  I bought a year's supply because they were on special, so at least they clean well.  I do wish there was a way to minimize the individual wrappers.  I wonder if I can recycle them.  I put them in a big clear glass jar on my counter above my dshwasher, so they do look sparkly and decorative in my kitchen.  Probably not the look the manufacturer thought of, but I figured I would make the best of my oversight.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Love finish for my dishwasher. Been using it for years. This was a larger package and a very good price. Unless price goes up too much I will be buying again. Have it set up to buy every couple months.12/19 someone asked about tablets being broken earlier & I  said I  never had this experience. This last box I opened a week or so ago it seems every 2nd or 3rd one I take out is broken. It's a bigger box than I've ever bought more room to bounce around I suppose but this has never happened before. Not pleased with this but use them and they still clean but would rather them be in 1 piece.. took 1 star off. Will add back if next box aren't broken up.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Works great, tried washing with out it. Dishes wasn't that clean, still had food on it. After using this Dishes came out clean..",positive,dishwashing tablet
The product is great- works perfectly. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is that each tablet is individually wrapped. Awful packaging  - so wasteful.,positive,dishwashing tablet
My only complaint if there isn‚Äôt a reason these can‚Äôt be open in the container. They are all individually wrapped and so wasteful and an extra step from container to dishwasher.Also sometimes they don‚Äôt fully dissolve but isn‚Äôt a huge issue most the time.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"This is the only detergent my dishwasher will use. Each pod is individually wrapped. This can be a godsend or pain in the butt. The pro to having them individually wrapped is that they don‚Äôt all become sticky and come together, but the con is that you have to unwrap one every time you need to start a load. I also which it came in a more durable container. I dumped them into a big plastic tub so the flattened box that it came in wouldn‚Äôt continue to split them everywhere.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall a great product, but once again, Packaging problem. The package was smashed a bit at the top, and some of the pods had come out. Not a huge deal since they're individually wrapped, but some of them when I open them are crumbly. Considering the price for these things, that's a bit irritating at the very least. Plus, don't like to get that stuff on my hands, as they're filled with caustic chemicals.Just always strikes me a little bit sad to have a really good product, only to leave a negative mark on the experience because of laziness in the packaging process.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Product works great, especially in a stainless DW. Really made interior look like new after two years of using liquid paste product.My beef is somewhat of a MINOR  one as these individual tablets are wrapped in foil, come in a light cardboard box,  and need to be opened first and placed in soap compartment.Other Finish tabs are wrapped in dissolvable plastic and go right in soap compartment without contact of soap ingredients of tablet.It‚Äôs true that if you get wetness inside of the plastic tablet container of dissolving tabs, you might create a sticky mess ( dry hands only) but I think I prefer the dissolvable ones better.Easier to work with. üòÄAlso...don‚Äôt use additional liquid ‚Äúspot remover‚Äù in DW as you may upset the balance of the provided red ‚Äúspot remover‚Äù of tablet.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall these are decent dishwasher detergent tablets. Some of the tablets come broken and the red center is detached from the tablet portion. The price is good, but I don't feel like this soap cleans my dishes as well as other brands.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Well! Let me first say that this is my favorite dishwasher detergent brand. I was super happy to see that I could get a giant box of this stuff on Amazon. I WILL admit that what I received surprised me when I opened the little washer packet, mostly because I thought from the picture that this was the kind that had the gel layer. These are the ones that are the solid (powdered) detergent. This means I likely won‚Äôt get this box of them again, because I do prefer the ones that have the combination solid and gel layer. I think those do the best job and seem to work better with my dishwasher. However, these are also good, so they will definitely be used, and I will look around on Amazon to see if I can find a big box of the others that I prefer.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I didn't realize that each tablet needs to be unwrapped before use.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Product is great only drawback is this is the one you have to open each one verus the finsh with the self disolving wrapper.  Otherwise I would have given 5 stars.  ( more my fault for orderingthe wrong one),positive,dishwashing tablet
My only complaint is that the tablets come in an individual foil wrapper which you have to peel off and dispose of.  I wish they came in a clear plastic dissolvable package.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Some of the reviewed here complained about damage to the pods.  I risked it and figured that I was reasonably close to a distribution hub and it would not be a problem.  The actual problem is that the box was shipped in a vinyl envelope only.  No real protection.  The product box came with rounded corners from being bounced around and about 20% of the pods were either broken to dust or cracked.  Not enough to return but enough to buy my next batch at my local big box store.The pods themselves are very good.  Easy to use, and cleans my dishes well.  No complaints.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"So far so good!Hope it will change to not individual package of each cube, reduce the waste.",positive,dishwashing tablet
This product is suprising me a lot.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great,positive,dishwashing tablet
Honest review here.I found this to be good value for the price.  I usually prefer the liquid pods but these dissolved well and worked great.  There was never any weird residue left in the dishwasher from the solids which is great.I would definitely buy again!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I opened these about five days ago. I am visually impaired and I opened the box and placed one tablet in dishwasher and ran it. Today five days later my granddaughter, 11, asked what all the silver things were in the dishwasher. She got them out. So my dishes were not being washed. So I tried to open one to put in dishwasher and I could not open so I had to poke it with a sharp meatfork. I don't like these.  They seem old, old fashioned and hard. Nothing like the last Finish I bought in March and loved.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This dishwashing soap works better than anything we have found. It gets our dishes clean and only occasionally do we have to scrub a pan that doesn‚Äôt get the cooked on food off. I don‚Äôt have a problem with that. One complaint is that it removed the writing on our Pyrex measuring cup, so after replacing it we now wash that by hand. The only other complaint is that it eats aluminum. We had to throw out our aluminum ice cream scoop because the metal started stuffing off on our ice cream, so avoid putting anything aluminum in the dishwasher. To leave on a good note, it does make our copper pans shine without scrubbing and polishing.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Product does a great job. And is of good value. Just want to note that the packaging on this shipment was barely ok. I received it yesterday, Sunday......great service. The package was an Amazon envelope and product inside....Fine. But not not safe for being tossed or pushed into the mailbox by USPS. Amazon envelop was in good shape but should have been packed with something inside. The box popped open and most of the tablets were on the bottom of the bag. All seem undamaged, but not good packaging on this shipment. (All tabs are wrapped individuals.)",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I buy this brand because it smells less awful than the other brands. No longer do I need to wash my tea cup when it comes out of the dishwasher to get rid of the smell of the dishwasher detergent. But it seems to have a short shelf life, if you buy it more than about 6 months before using, the cakes just crumble when you open the packages. We often buy supplies ahead, and it doesn't work well for this product.BTW, it seems to do a great job cleaning dishes, but so do other brands that I have tried.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Works well, good value. Was shipped in an envelope instead of a box, so the cardboard box it came in was totally destroyed. They are hard pucks instead of gel packs, so they survived fine.Only complaint besides shipping is that each one is individually wrapped in plastic, which is both wasteful/bad for the environment, but also is just annoying to have to open every time with wet hands after doing dishes. (although with the poor shipping method, this actually worked out well for me this time).",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Overall I like the product. I rated this 4 stars now as the new box I received has many broken tablets so I have to open the packages over the dish washer. In addition, I am not a fan of the individually wrapped tablets as I do not think it is environmentally safe, but luckily they are individually wrapped otherwise the box would have been a powder mess. I just hope in the future the packaging is of better quality or I might have to choose a different one.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This product itself is good,  however if you go to Costco and buy a tub of these pucks,  they come in easy to use pucks that dissolve, there is no plastic to remove or dispose of.  This seems to be the older product that requires you to tear open a mylar wrapper and dispose of it.  This creates unnecessary plastic landfill that the more modern Finish product doesnt use.  So on this point, this product has been improved since and I wouldnt buy the Finish product in this box or packaging again.  Only buy the Finish that is in the fully dissolvable pucks going forward.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Met expectations,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Dishes, glasses and silverware are always super clean in our Bosch dishwasher.  Best pricing we found on these tabs.  Little foil wrapping is hard to grip and open.  Too many of the tabs are broken inside their wrapping, not sure if that's from rough handling during shipping.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This is the brand I always use, and normally purchase it from Costco. I wanted to add it to my subscribe and save so I got it through Amazon. The product works just fine, however, I‚Äôm disappointed because each pod is individually wrapped unlike the pods I normally purchase from the store.  Needless to say I won‚Äôt be ordering this again!  Unwrapping each pod is not only annoying but it‚Äôs also environmentally unfriendly.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These clean well but I think I received some old ones.  The product is a pressed powdered detergent cube in an aluminum type wrapper.  They have to be unwrapped before using and most of them are dried out and dissolve into powder in my hands while unwrapping occasionally.  I never had this problem with another box I bought at a supermarket.  I will  buy the gel ones from now on from another brand.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I would like to give this product a 5 star out of 5 but since I have to purchase another product to keep my glassware steak free not happy bout it. It should have been added to this product as an upgrade and not an option. I‚Äôm pretty sure every consumer would love to use all their glassware clear and shiny as advertised.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The packets are not the easiest to open and several have been busted already when went to open so that made for more cleanup. But as far as cleaning your dishes these do really good and have very little spotting(water spots) left on dishes,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The headline says it all and this is why I'm giving the product 4 stars.  These tablets work well but during shipping, many are broken up, so you have pieces and grains that are almost impossible to use.  In fact, I've thrown a few away.  I don't know the solution - maybe better packing.  All I know is that about 10 percent of these are useless.  But the other 90 percent are greaet.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"The functionality is good but the packaging is lacking.  The box was broken, the pads were spilled out, and many were broken inside the individual wrappers.  I don't love that they are each wrapped since it is just another bit of trash to occupy the landfills; however, with the soft nature of the tablets and the rough transit, the wrappers allowed many crushed ones to still be used.  I will probably try something else next time.",positive,dishwashing tablet
It works good,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Okay, so as im sure people going through reviews have seen this product does have some issues sometimes. Some of the packages arent perfect and sometimes you do get a dud and have to rewash. Now let me ask you, how much do you pay for these somewhere else? Certainly not 15 bucks for 94 of them. Its more like 12 for 34 or something like that. For all the new people, its worth it. Even if they are broken, put them in there - they dissolve and work great. The product doesnt have to be perfect to work. Will buy again.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"When I couldn't get this product about 2 months ago, I ordered the orange gelpaks. Noticed, recently, that glasses in my dishwasher came out with a yellowish/orange cast. Clearly, there was some residue left on utensils, etc. in the dishwasher. Ordered the Finish powerball product when it became available through Amazon. Not well packaged; about 8 or 10 of the pods were open, broken or damaged. The pods work well; but buying something with a 10% or greater defect rate is not my idea of quality packaging.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Love the BULK package of this near-daily used product.  Cleans dishes spotless in my Bosch DW's 1HR cycle.  But as we all know ... it's all about HOW you LOAD the DW.  Bosch provides detailed instructions for loading which I read and followed, but sadly, my wife hasn't.  As a result ‚Ä¶ I do the dishes in the family.My one pet peeve (minus one star):  Even though these tablets are individually-wrapped in space-age plastiluminum packages ‚Ä¶ over time I have noticed evidence of moisture-damage to the wrapped tablets.  Humidity sensitive?  I have no water leaks under the sink.  The packages are also a pain to unwrap and always result in only a slightly torn corner that require more manipulation to unpeel.  Ugh.  It should take no more than ONE PULL to free these tabs.  Cheap packaging.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Very easy to use in dishwasher,positive,dishwashing tablet
Does the job.  Probably could find something less expensive and just as good‚Ä¶,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Finish Powerball works well in my dishwasher.  I subtracted 1 star because this batch isn't the same as my previous order, these are individually wrapped and must be taken out of the package to use.  The previous order came individually wrapped but could be put into dishwasher whole and the wrapper would dissolve, much more convenient.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I would have preferred to have purchased the pods that don't require opening an outer layer to remove the pod before placing into the dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great little dish-cleaning bricks!My ONLY disappointment is that each little brick is individually wrapped in foiled plastic.We know about how each of these things impact our planet, and should be better in making packaging choices.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I'd say 50 percent or more of these tabs are straight powder when you open the pack.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I loved the price point for these. They are not the best ones out there but for the money they do the job.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I've seen quite a few people complaining about residue or broken tablets. So far, all of my tablets have been packaged correctly and intact. I also have only noticed residue one time, but I needed to clean out my dishwasher filter anyway. Your dishwasher may be sensitive to rinsing properly like mine if that needs changed. Apart from that one time, not residue left on dishes. It's not going to give you a shine like some of the more expensive detergents.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I have to re-do my review and take away a star. That is because more the half the box contained broken packets. While they still work fine, it's not what I paid for, and an added hassle to shake all the pieces into the holder. Otherwise, I have no complaints.",positive,dishwashing tablet
If there is food still in plates it doesn‚Äôt clean them off as well but if you rinse the food off they come out very clean,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Yes, these are powdery and crumbled.  They seem to be an ""outlet"" item.  I had no problem with them cleaning just as good, but using them is annoying.  They are definitely cheaper and more convenient via Amazon, but I did stop sub/save and started getting at my local Kroger because I do find them being in an actual tablet form a lot easier to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"The detergent tabs clean dishes well enough, but the box I received was missing about 10 tabs and several were unwrapped and broken making a mess in the box.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These are a great value. They clean great. Better than others in this price point per use. The only issue I have is after you get half way through the box the bottom ones are crushed. Not sure if this is a packaging issue or shipping issue. I am still able to use them. Just have to not spill the crumbs when opening. Would still buy again doesn't effect cleaning ability.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I have 2 complaints about his product: I hate having to peel off the foil, I wish they had a pod which you can take straight from the box and put it in the machine.  Secondly, most of the pods are broken but it does the job",positive,dishwashing tablet
I bought these because of the really good price.  This is the same product you would buy in a store only at a reduced price.  Watch for their sale and buy it,positive,dishwashing tablet
"They work great, just wish packaging could be made biodegradable.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I love this product- I found that this tab works best for my heavy loads! And I was excited about the save and subscribe price. These are the individually wrapped packs, which is an additional step. While I don‚Äôt love the extra waste in packaging, as a mom of small children it is nice to know that if one of these gets into the hands of my kids (don‚Äôt worry, I do store them out of reach, but you never know!) that they won‚Äôt be able to pop them in their mouth. Some, not many, of the tabs were broken when I opened them, but not so much so that it made it difficult to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This has happened again. I‚Äôve used only 5 pods from my new box and 1 package was empty, sealed and empty. Two more have been in large pieces. And now one of them is completely crushed into powder.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"They are all broken‚Ä¶ will work ok in dishwasher, but wonder why all the tablets are broken",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Just an FYI, these come individually wrapped.  Such a waste of packaging and a pain to unwrap each one.  Ugh.  I really like the ones that come in a dissolvable wrap or just plain.  These are a terrible foil type wrap that you throw away.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Ordered these ahead of time since they were on sale. Packaging received was slightly beaten up. Upon opening the pod wrapping, the pod received seem old. So far I have used 2 and both times the pod didn‚Äôt even dissolved. They leave powdery residue on the bottom of my dishwasher.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great on cleaning my dishes but sometimes I've noticed it leaves a little bit if a film on my dishes and have to rinse them after pulling them out of the dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
You need to remove from packaging before use .,positive,dishwashing tablet
I didn‚Äôt realize these are individually wrapped.  Some of them are crushed when I open.  I have bought these before that were loose in a bag which I prefer.  I like this brand over other.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product but probably not for a family with young children. Packaging looks like a fun size candy bar. Could be enticing for little ones to try to open and eat.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"You need to unwrap every individual packet/pellet before using.  Finish sells another form with dissolvable wrappers, which is much easier and more sustainable - no wrapper to throw away!Aside from that issue, the dishwasher detergent works great.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"They wash fine, but it‚Äôs annoying that they are individually packaged and powdery and kinda a pain to open.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I‚Äôm too lazy to return this to get a replacement but the box was open when I opened the Amazon box and some of the pods exploded. There was detergent powder in the box and it was a bit of a mess. It otherwise works like usual.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Used for dishwasher and I do not like having to open the package tablet.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The pods worked well and definitely offer good value. However, the first couple of them appeared to be broken but after that all of them have worked well.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Some are broken, but they are in closed in a wrapper, so no foul.  Work great.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These seem to do a pretty good job of getting the dishes clean. Wish I had looked more closely though- all the tablets are individually packaged in plastic. Super wasteful and also adds a couple annoying seconds to unwrap it.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I have been purchasing these for years because they work well and are a good value. However, I have noticed the red power ball leaves a weird purplish streak at the bottom of the dishwasher where the door opens/closes. It's kind of hard to scrub off too.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These dishwasher tablets do the trick but I dislike the inconvenience of unwrapping every single tablet after loading the dishwasher. These wrappers generate a lot of waste so if you're trying to reduce your carbon footprint I would not recommend these.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Individual wrappings must be removed, a minor inconvenience. So far about one in five is broken inside sealed package. Seeing other reviews of broken product I wonder if these are factory QC rejects??Never had this problem with ‚Äúbrick and mortar‚Äù store bought pods.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"They do a great job cleaning my dishes, but I cringe every time I throw away the wrapper from the individually wrapped pods.  Had I known that all the pods were individually wrapped I wouldn't have purchased.  Very unnecessary packaging.  I would probably not buy again just for this reason.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This product works real well in our high-end dishwasher that processes naturally soft water. What I like about it is also what I hate about it: the wrapper. The packaging keeps the cake moisture-free, so it doesn't swell, as the other packets do, which causes them to lose their shape and interfere with the detergent-release door. At the same time, the wrapper is a bit of a hassle to remove, and it's yet another piece of junk heading into the waste stream.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"My only gripe is that these come wrapped in foil, which you have to unwrap. The last pack I bought had the hot water soluble coating, so that's what I expected here. Great tabs though!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great product, but a ton of waste. Each pod is individually wrapped within the package.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Wow. This is my first time using Finish for my dishwasher and it works wonderfully! It really scrubs the grime off of my dishes and it dries without leaving spots. I am pretty impressed with this little pod. One downside is that they are all individually wrapped and I feel that it's a bit wasteful so I'm taking a star away for that reason.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Most of the time it does the job.But when cleaning glass lids of pots or pans, the convex sides of surface are still greasy.The positioning may matter.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Doesn‚Äôt clean as well as my other brand. So disappointed. Now stuck with a full box,positive,dishwashing tablet
Love how the dishes are shiney and perfectly clean.  Do not like taking the silver wrap off.  I prefer the other dissolving wrap.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"This brand was a free sample when we got our dishwasher. Have continued to use this brand. Only issue is a lot of them don‚Äôt disssolve, which requires running the washer again.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great value. Does job. The only thing that bothers me is it leaves residue on the dishes unlike other pods I get. But for value, I would recommend.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"using it for my new dishwashing machine, good and no compliant, it did the job.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I bought them when there was a deal.That being said, more than half of the cubes were cracked or split in half. I am not sure if that was the reason for the lower price.I would stay with pods.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"product size is misrepresented ,I guess they don't expect u to count them, some were bigger size & did not release from soap section because it was stuck in there,otherwise  cleaned well !",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Most of the tablets are broken in a few pieces, so I have to 'pour' them into the dishwasher detergent bay. Otherwise it is good.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I use this product all the time. Inky several if packers were cracked inside? Maybe 6 iut if 10 so far?,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I am very disappointed with the quality of this product.  I thought since it had a big name it would leave my dishes and glasses sparkling clean.  I have residue and water spots since using this.  Back to my cheaper stuff.  Sorry, not worth the money.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I love this soap the only one I use, but this go round they did not such a great job packaging and the heavier items crushed all the soap cubes...note to self don't order cat litter and compressed powder products together.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These Finish dishwasher ""blocks' do a great job but I was disappointed that this particular version has each block wrapped in foil rather than the auto-dissolving coating. I hate unwrapping them and it creates trash for landfill. Buy another version.",positive,dishwashing tablet
As expected,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good value.  Works well. Only complaint is the hard to open little packages - have to use scissors to cut them open.,positive,dishwashing tablet
It is a fine detergent in terms of cleaning capabilities but ever since moving from Cascade I've noticed a lot more water spots on my dishes. As a detergent it does exactly what it's supposed to do and removes some of the more baked-on stains from my dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
fits in soap dispenser...no measuring no problem,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I am sensitive to fragrances. It is getting more difficult to get scent-free dishwashing products that clean my dishes. And I hate the dissolving pods. Finish is scented, but each finish tablet is wrapped in foil, so I am only exposed to fragrance and fumes for the short time I unwrap the tablet, place it in its comparment, and close my dishwasher. There are no fumes during or after the washing cycle. Finish does a great cleaning job, even when I don't rinse my dishes before putting them in the dishwasher.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Bought these by accident. Main downside is they are a compressed powder, in an individual mylar packet that has to be opened. Sometimes the red pellet is detached. Opening the package to get it out then put it in the cup means you have to handle it. Does a good job of cleaning the dishes but prefer the gel type that don't need to be opened.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Great product except that I find that they are more likely to not dissolve during the wash cycle compared to liquid pouches. Still relatively rare though and it could easily be my older dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The box is cardboard rather than the more durable plastic pail that some competitors use which leads to some broken tablets.Overall the dishes come out clean but sometimes a little spotty.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I got it on sale. Each tablet has a wrapper so it needs to be opened and discarded every time. Dishes come out clean though.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Love Finish products but they tend to short the packages. This 94 tab pack has 85 tabs. My previous purchase resulted in the same issues... and I call Finish every time. Count your tabs!!!!!!!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I like the product, but when it arrived the outside of the box (as well as other products in the the package) was covered in powder.  Inside the box of Finish every packet was covered in powder and there was at least one empty packet. The box itself felt as if it had been wet.  Will not likely order this particular product from Amazon again.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Great product and great price.,positive,dishwashing tablet
great value,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The product is great.  However, it was just thrown in an envelope and handed over to package abusers.  Product box was busted open and individual soap tablets busted out of their wrappings.  Whatever, most of the time they get it right, just not this time.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These work very well. We have hard water and these help the dishwasher power through the grease and food.But every Powerball is in a slippery plastic protective packet that you have to tear open (usually with wet hands) and it's not fun. Surely they could make the little packets less slippery. Put a ""tread"" on them or make them of a different material.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"This brand and these pods work great. Only thing I don‚Äôt like it how they are all individually wrapped üò¨ The ones I bought previously had the ‚Äúplastic‚Äù on them that dissolved in the dishwasher. These don‚Äôt, and it‚Äôs annoying.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Really like this one. Doesn‚Äôt leave a residue.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Some finish washer tablets come with each tab individually wrapped in a clear self dissolving wrapper.  Those are great and easy to use.  These come individually wrapped in plastic foil.  Not only does it take a few seconds to remove, but all of this bits of plastic are going into our landfill for no reason. I strongly recommend Finish dishwasher tablets, but advise you buy the ones that do not have the individual foil wrap.",positive,dishwashing tablet
dishwasher and I like the detergent very much but hate that you have to take off he silver wrapper because then you have to have contact with the pod and the other ones that you don't have to unwrap to put in dishwasher are better.,positive,dishwashing tablet

Cleans very well. My only annoyance is the dumb little wrapper I have to remove,positive,dishwashing tablet
I originally bought this because using the water soluble gel packs weren't dissolving properly in my dishwasher. I don't get this problem as often now but it still happens every now and then.,positive,dishwashing tablet

Let's see...what did I like about this product? It does a great job ‚ÄºÔ∏è,positive,dishwashing tablet

"I did not experience the white residue that some other customers mention, and in fact my dishes had that feeling that gives meaning to the phrase ""squeaky clean"" when they came out.However, I was a bit disappointed that these come individually wrapped, in silver foil packets like mini-candy bars (thank providence I don't have children) which means you have to take an extra step, fumbling with the wrapper, and then also have waste.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"they come individual packs of dry cubes, some are so dry they are cracked or chipped and broken, but can still be used in the dishwasher, I would prefer the liquid next time",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I prefer the open each tab type of dish soap. The pod type leave behind the plastic residue. That can gum up the modern sensor (HE) dishwasher.Update: Amazon seems to beat up the package, the tabs are broken and some smashed.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These work great but why does the company spend extra money to individually wrap each one in plastic? It‚Äôs a pain to remove and I prefer the ones that come straight out of the box and go directly into the dishwasher!,positive,dishwashing tablet
They just don‚Äôt get everything clean all the time it‚Äôs a hit or miss,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I had purchased these years ago and then switched over to the gel-pack type.  I recently purchased them again.  No problem with the product performance but I recall now why I stopped buying them - the packaging.

Washes dishes ok. But the tablets begin to deteriorate before I get them all used.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"They work well, but I don't love that they're all individually packed. Seems like an unnecessary and not eco friendly step.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These tabs were better than what I had been using and these get the glasses very clean .  Does a nice job on the dishes too.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Bought this because it was what the manufacturer of my new dishwasher recommended. It really worked much better than the gel stuff I had been buying from the grocery store. I will be buying this again.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Nothing special but the size is very convenient.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Seems to work pretty well. Don‚Äôt love the individual packaging but first world problems.,positive,dishwashing tablet

Not bad but leaves film on dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
These tabs are a bit different then the ones I expected to receive.  My last mega order I received tabs that did not come in a wrapped foil packet - these do.  It's a bit of an extra step and wasteful.  However I still enjoy the product and it cleans my dishes well.,positive,dishwashing tablet

And before Corporate says they don't they may not look like chocolate outside of the wrapper but the detergent looks like hard sugar candy like Sweet Tarts, The wrapper is a foil like 3 Musketeers or Milky Way.

It's the same dishwasher detergent you buy at the grocer.  Only difference is the red ball part is broken in every individual pack and you have to fish it out and put it in the dishwasher compartment if you want to use it.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I put zero thought into the brand/type of my dish soap until I met my current curmudgeonly machine. My previous dishwashers were no spring chickens either and yet always worked fine with whatever was on sale, so I never even realized detergent could make such a difference. I thought I was just doomed to handwashing until I tried pods instead of liquid once on a whim and got much better results. After a bit more experimenting, my quest for perfectly clean, spot-free dishes finally ended here!Although I tried several other pods that initially showed promise, they were just too unreliable. The ones that were wrapped in plastic were especially problematic for me, as the exterior often failed to fully melt, even on the hottest water setting. That's a non-issue with these pods though. They're just little blocks of concentrated powder that dissolve completely and evenly each time. Every dish gets washed thoroughly without fail whether I vigorously rinse them or not, and there's never any soapy residue.I've been happily using these pods for months and have had no further issues. They really work miracles in my finicky, old machine, so I can only imagine what they can do in newer technology!",positive,dishwashing tablet
We've been using these tablets now for 3-4 years my Wife and I. They clean great and leave our dishes spotless on the Whirlpool and Hotpoint dishwashers we've used. They leave no markings or streaks that we've seen after using them. For about $10-$15 every few months they really come in handy for us for an 94-pack we're usually set for a while. If you're looking for good inexpensive dishwasher tablets the Finish brand are good bang for your buck. They are cheap and clean well.,positive,dishwashing tablet
These are great.  They come individually wrappedAt first I thought it was inconvenient but I love it more.  If I reach in with wet hands not all of them get ruined,positive,dishwashing tablet

"These were recommended to us by the service technician who installed our dishwasher. He said that the dishwasher detergent that comes in the soft gel like package will gum up the dishwasher overtime, and he recommended these since they just compacted powder. Having used these for over 6 months now, I can say our dishwasher washes our dishes just as well as the day it was installed. Dishes come out perfectly clean the first time, and I've never had an issue with leftover residue or undissolved detergent. The pack of 94 tabs has lasted us over 6 months and I'd say we probably wash dishes at least 3-4 times a week. I do typically always wash our dishes on the hottest sanitize setting, so maybe the other reviewers who are having issues with residue aren't using the hottest setting. I had used Cascade before, but I will be sticking with these from now on.",positive,dishwashing tablet

"Yes, you have to unwrap these, but they get the dishes clean! The tabs that don't need to be unwrapped, the ones in the plastic, may promise the world, but that plastic does not dissolve in my dishwasher no matter where I place them (on the bottom of the dishwasher, or in the cup).  The Powerball Deep Clean tabs in the foil that need to be unwrapped are golden as far as I'm concerned. Good price, and they get the job done.

"My dishes come out spotless without using a special rinse. The only thing I didn‚Äôt like about them is that each tablet is wrapped individually in a foil packet you have to tear open and sometimes (rarely) this breaks off little pieces. I think that applies only to this big box package. I think the smaller quantities in a bag don‚Äôt have that but, it‚Äôs not hard to tear.",positive,dishwashing tablet

I prefer dishwashing tablets without the plastic casing around the tablet. The casing doesn't always dissolve even in the hottest water. I was happy to find this bargain on Amazon.

"I jumped on the Finish train after I used the Finish dishwasher liquid cleaner a couple of times and my family and I loved the results and the clean scent. Normally I used Cascade dishwasher pods and it's been that way for over a year or so. I'm now fully converted to Finish.Cascade pods have a tendency to leak because of the gel on top. This can cause pods to stick together in the container. Finish dishwasher pacs are individually wrapped which was a nice surprise. If the Finish pacs break off or crumble then it is all contained in each individual wrapping. I'm not sure if that's great for the environment but it's certainly convenient for this customer.I also found that Cascade didn't clean my dishes as well, hence the reason why I had to purchase the Finish dishwasher cleaner in the first place. I wasn't very familiar with the brand but once I used it I really liked it. Finish dishwasher pacs have the same great scent and in my opinion they give my dishes a deeper clean.",positive,dishwashing tablet

Second time ordering. Great bargain. Can't get this kind of bargain in my local grocery store. Lasts for months and months and months and months!!! Does a good job on my dishes. Have well water and a septic. Doesn't harm my septic like others with all the extra bells and whistles that are supposed to get dishes cleaner and spotless.

My glassware always come out sparkling clean. (I confess that I also use Finish rinse agent)  I have this product on a subscribe order so I always have it on hand.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"does as good of a job as tabs that cost 2x or more then this one. My dishwasher doesn't like the 'gel' pack ones. It seems to build up mildew looking stuff inside if i don't use a powder (or compressed powder in this case). This tab and rinse aid produces the best results for me. I miss the old dishwashers over these new ""energy efficient"" dishwashers that run for 4 hours where the old one washed for an hour and gave you as good results if not better. Doesn't leave a real strong smell, leaves it smelling clean instead. I'm not bothered if some of them are crushed inside the packages, it all goes in the dishwasher, whether its a solid brick or a brick that's been crushed up, it does not affect the outcome of the load of dishes. Also dont like the 'self dissolving' no-need-to-unwrap packaging. This is so much better. Would ABSOLUTELY recommend.",positive,dishwashing tablet

"We have been using this product for several years.  Our dishes come out of the dishwasher very clean and dry.  However, there is an issue with about 20% of the tablets being damaged.  1 out of 5 of the individual tablets when opened are crushed and a combination of powder and small chunks.  It's more of an irritation as the product still cleans.  We've learned to not open the tablets over the kitchen counter or over the floor as sometimes the products makes a mess.  Also, if we do encounter a crumbled tablet and we have a large load of dirty pots, pans & dishes, we have to open a second package to make sure the product works as it is supposed to as designed.  If not in tact, the product still works, but not as effectively.  We are trying to find another product at this time that comes intact and not damaged.",positive,dishwashing tablet

My things come out, literally, squeaky clean. I dont torture test my machine or the Finish. But there are some tough food stuffs left on things. It gets them right off.Best example I can give: my metal fine mesh strainers. Used primarily for draining pasta. No matter how I would hand wash them before, sponge, dish brush, there was always that lack of shine. The strainers remained dull. Well, the strainers fir within my dishwasher, so I did. Put them in, put in the Finish pod and when everything was done, I was shocked. My strainers looked as if I had just brought them! They were shiny once again and totally clean.",positive,dishwashing tablet

"I used my old dishwasher for 31 years.  I always used the store brand cheapest powder and my dishes always sparkled.  Then, I bought a new dishwasher that said you should use the rinse.  I didn't use the rinse agent with my old dishwasher, why would I need it with my fancy new dishwasher?  Well, after a few washes all the glasses and silverware come out cloudy and I had to add the rinse agent which squirted all over the place when I tried to fill the rinse receptacle.  I wasted half of it.I decided to try these Finish Powerballs about a year ago and haven't looked back.  I don't need to add the rinse agent to make my dishes sparkle.  I also use it in the clunky old dishwasher in the condo we rent and it works great there too.  But then, the old dishwashers worked so much better than the new ones even though they cleared out the kitchen with the noise.This is a good product that I will continue to use.",positive,dishwashing tablet

These tables are super easy to use and do a great job.  Doesn't leave a film on glasses,positive,dishwashing tablet
Never fails!,positive,dishwashing tablet
You rarely have to rinse the food off the plates/bowls or silverware. It does all the work and my dirty dishes come out clean. I bought multiple because it‚Äôs an awesome deal. They‚Äôre double the price on stores.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Super easy to use.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love Finish it doesn‚Äôt leave soap build up in my dishwasher,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I dislike the smell of some of the more famous dishwasher pods, but these have a pleasant smell to them.  I went through a lot of dishwasher soaps that I didn't like, but when I found this one, I stopped looking.  It does a good job and is very easy to use.  They are individually wrapped in what seems to be a tin foil, so you take them out of the packaging before you use them.  With the pods that are surrounded by some sort of soft plastic looking/feeling something or other, I never liked the thought of melted whatever it was getting onto the things I eat with and off of.  With Finish, I don't worry about that, since there is no plastic around it.  There hasn't been any etching and I have been using these for a very long time now (well over 6 years).  Yay!",positive,dishwashing tablet

"I love Finish products! The scent is so good and my dishes never need to be re-washed, they come out sparkly clean! My whole kitchen be smelling good! Definitely recommend this product.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Great purchase!!,positive,dishwashing tablet
The only thing about this is the individually wrapped tabets. It cleans great! Cascade put too much Dawn in it which over suds the dishwasher. Would like to sample Finish's other products to determine the upgrade. Not going to through away money in which you have to run the rinse cycle.,positive,dishwashing tablet
                    The media could not be loaded.                ¬†This brand and combo seem to get my dishes the most clean with our water here in FL. They dissolve well and leave no residue. This is the 3rd time I have ordered these.,positive,dishwashing tablet

This Finish is awesome! There aren't any more food stains left on my dishes like when I used to buy the store brand. The scent is good too. Of course it's easier to use than the liquid. And this price is great!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Really does agreatjob on the dishes. Plates with egg yolk from a week ago, no problem (hey, I live alone and do dishes once a week, it works for me). Pots and pans with who knows what stuck on them, no problem. No pre-rinsing or washing needed. Glass wear, flat wear, whatever comes out clean.Now for the bad news. The tablets are individually wrapped, and not too well. Some of the wrappers are half off, some completely off, some tablets are broken.All in all I can live with the crappy packaging because of the great cleaning and very attractive price point.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Out of all the dishwasher detergents I have tried, this is the best one for me. It cleans my dishes in one run. Plus, since I only do one load a day, the box lasts at least two months! Great product and great deal for the price!",positive,dishwashing tablet

"I'm lazy and don't like to wash dishes or measure out the detergent. I toss these in and I almost never have any issues with things not being clean.

"When we bought our Bosch dishwasher, there was a sample of these pellets included with it and a sticker on the inside that recommended Finish dishwashing tablets. Now...I know that this is just a marketing thing and that Finish probably paid Bosch a bunch of money to have that stuff put in there. However, I don't have any dishwasher detergent loyalty...so after I used up the samples and found that my dishes were coming out perfect every time. I stuck with it. I've been buying this same brand for years and it does a great job!An added benefit that I didn't realize...because all the detergent is compacted into a little puck...and the puck falls down into the dishwasher when it's released from the holder, you NEVER get undissolved detergent stuck in the little holder the way some powders or liquids do from time to time.",positive,dishwashing tablet

I have always been a powder guy but I have switched over to these pods. They work really well.,positive,dishwashing tablet

Great amount for the price. I find if you break them up before putting them in the dishwasher they work better.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Finish get the dishes clean with one pod only.,positive,dishwashing tablet

"My company recommended this product and I do not see much problems, everything is shiny and no pre rinse is required cheaper than cascade.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I actually bought a damaged box, warehouse special. We‚Äôve been looking for a new detergent as we were using the Walmart version and it was not getting our dishes clean. The cascade actionpacs wouldn‚Äôt fit in the dispenser. I figured, the Amazon warehouse deal would be too good to pass up to try these out. Despite numerous complaints about receiving destroyed cubes instead of whole, we‚Äôve had no issues at all with this damaged box pack. The amount of crap it gets off the dishes is amazing and I can‚Äôt wait to try out the Quantum after we kill off this pack. I barely have to do any scrubbing at all. I‚Äôve been very happy with my purchase so far and look forward to sticking with Finish brand in the future for my dishwashing needs.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I like breaking the bigger side off for the pre-wash and putting the other side with the red rinse ball in the wash side It also helps save on wear and tear on the washer. Too much soap can damage. Another trick is to just let your items air dry.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Don't have a dishwasher but I use these as a toilet bowl cleaner. I dropped them in the tank and it keeps my toilet bowl clean.  I also use them to soak my stove grates.  Cuts the grease right off the grates, makes it so much easier to clean.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I like the scent and the fact that the tablet cleans well and totally dissolves.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works well.  Very convenient.  Good priced as far as the tabs go.,positive,dishwashing tablet
The dishwasher tabs that are shrink wrapped don‚Äôt dissolve in my dishwasher. These have individual foil-like wrappers that you remove when before you put them in the dishwasher and start it. Just the ticket! So glad to have found them.,positive,dishwashing tablet

"I first went with these simply for the price and convenience of the large pack, but these really do a good job.  I like that they are single packs with the little brick like thing that you place in the detergent slot on the machine. These do well cleaning and don't seem to leave a film ( I also do use JetDry) and do not leave any scent, which other detergents in the past that I have tried do and I really do not appreciate detergent scented dishes. I want them to smell like NOTHING, that to me means they are clean!  These dissolve completely and also do not leave any remnants of detergent in the machine slot.  Great for when the kids in the house are in charge of dishes as it also ensures they get the correct amount of detergent in each time.",positive,dishwashing tablet
These work well and get my dishes clean.My only ask would be if they could figure out a way to not have them individually wrapped so it reduces the waste.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I'm a bachelor that does a lot of cooking and being retired from the home appliance business, I have seen and used my share of dishwasher soap products. These do an amazing job! I still used liquid Cascade or similar in the first cup, but have started using these in the second (long wash) dispenser. At the risk of sounding like one of the hucksters on a TV commercial, my dishes, pans, utensils, and especially glassware, have never been cleaner. No spots either!  Safe for septic systems too. I Highly recommend.",positive,dishwashing tablet

"When I purchased my dishwasher, the technician strongly suggested Finish.  I had thought all dishwasher detergents were pretty much the same so I bought cheaper brands.  The cheaper brands were not doing a good job so I bought Finish.  Finish made a huge difference and my dishes and glasses were so much cleaner!  I have been using Finish for decades now and I have not been disappointed.",positive,dishwashing tablet

"Finish dishwashing pods are a great alternative to Cascade and in many respect one might say they are better. Of course, it is all a matter of opinion. Finish dishwasher pods di exactly what they are intended to do:  they clean one‚Äôs dishes in the dishwasher. They leave a pleasant aroma that is distinct to Finish.  The product does not leave streaks on the dishes. It is an all-round great product. I highly recommend the product.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I  purchased the product to get rid of several hard water deposits and the calcium build up that I had in my 3 year old dishwasher.  The dishwasher smelled bad also.  Where I live we have horrible water, even with a water softener system.  After I used the product one time, I notice that the dishwasher was much cleaner but that there was still some ugly calcium build up at the bottom near the front.  I took a paper towel and all the build up quickly and easily came off.  I was thoroughly impressed.  The dishwasher almost looks new after only one use.  Great product.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Excellent Product,positive,dishwashing tablet
I've been using this for years,positive,dishwashing tablet
No film even on my plastics.  Also to test it out I put an empty container of butter not wiped out on the top rack and it came squeaky clean.  I was very very surprised.  All other detergent used the butter dish still had a greasy film on it and had to be rewashed by hand.  I also didn't wash my casserole pan out and the stuff was dried on and it came crystal clean.  I was soooo excited and very surprised.,positive,dishwashing tablet

"After using a bargain brand for while, I caught these on sale.I had forgotten how well some of these brand names are. I can even use the short cycle now.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I like the product which i have bought before in a plastic tub with a lid. These come in a box and each cube is separately wrapped like a fun size candy bar. I can see how a young child might mistake it for candy at least before the first taste! Thats not an issue for me personally but to have to unwrap each piece seems like an awful lot of extra packaging.  Anyway good product.,positive,dishwashing tablet
This was certainly a fantastic buy and I buy them repeatedly.,positive,dishwashing tablet
This item was ordered to keep my supply on hand for our dishwasher needs.  I bake and cook on a regular basis and our dishwasher is run at least once a day.  Finish is a brand I have come to trust over the years and it seems to work wonders with our water type.  I highly recommend this item in this large pack.  I also have decided to place this item on your handy subscription delivery once every three months. My first delivery was on time and as expected.Update:  Still using this product.  I noticed a few of the tablets come crumbled for some reason but are still usable.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I received a couple of these pods as samples when I purchased my new dishwasher.  I had some Finish brand tablets left so I used those for the first couple of wash cycles. They did an OK job, but some items were still a bit soiled and the drinking glasses were not very shiny. I thought something was wrong with my new dishwasher. I decided to try the sample cascade platinum pods instead and boy what a huge difference it made! Even though I placed greasy pots and pans along with drinking glasses in the same wash cycle, they all came out, completely clean and shiny! Not sure what to do with the Finish brand tablets. I guess I‚Äôll save those for very light soil load.  I purchased the large tub of these on Amazon, which I think is a great deal!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I ran out of this for a while and so wound up using a bottle of regular Cascade dishwasher detergent.  All of my dishes still had bits of stuff on them and my flatware all had a haze on them.  The first couple of loads I thought maybe there was some other reason, but nope, the regular versus just sucks in comparison.  When I went back to using these, my dishes went back to being perfectly clean and my flatware sparkled again.  I don't usually gush about a product, but this really is great.  I think I'll still with this from now on.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I‚Äôve tried all kinds of detergents at all price points, and these are the best.  Dishes come out clean without the need for pre-rinsing.  No spots, either!  I keep these on auto ship from Amazon because the value is great and the product works.",positive,dishwashing tablet
My dishwasher never leaves dirty dishes when using these pods. I tried cheaping out on dishwasher detergent one time and it just didn't do a good job. I'd rather pay a little extra money for these than to have to deal with dirty dishes from the dishwasher.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"This product cleans dishes and glasses better than most on the market. FYI.. If you run the water in your sink until it is hot.. then  ..start your dishwasher, you get the best results. If you are not using  Cascade now.. TRY IT  You won't be sorry.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I have a Bosch dishwasher that is super on its own, but with these pods the clean is squeaky clean and shiny. No residue. My husband  routinely leaves knives with peanut butter on them in the sink. I've accidentally popped them into the dishwasher without wiping off the excess junk. The knives come out shiny and clean with no pre-clean.  I get these automatically every 2 months from Amazon with no worries about running out or finding a bargain. A super product!",positive,dishwashing tablet
If you have a newer dishwasher the platinum is a must.  There supposed water conservation on newer dishwashers requires the extra  punch in the detergent.,positive,dishwashing tablet
No other pods work as well as these. Any time I use something else I‚Äôm disappointed. My dishes are sparkling clean every time I use them.,positive,dishwashing tablet
i find it great value and as a senior I dont have to carry from store  Delivery is an absolutely a plus,positive,dishwashing tablet
These little pods actually do clean up dirty dishes with no rinsing. All you need to do is scrap the dishes of food scraps so the dishwasher drain doesn't get clogged with leftover food particles.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"definitely does what it is supposed to do, removed hard debris from dishes. the smell is pleasant but very strong. it's a bit expensive online than buying at local grocery stores, found out its much cheaper at the store.",positive,dishwashing tablet
We used to use this all the time. I went cheap and bought the same brand but not platinum and had to run the dishwasher 2 or 3 times to get the same performance as the platinum. Ended up wasting time and redoing the dishes over and over.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I only use cascade for the dishwasher as it works very well. Dishes are spotless every time. I was surprised when I received this as it was handled poorly in shipping and the pods all ruptured and leaked all over the plastic container and shipping box. Amazon refunded me.,positive,dishwashing tablet

We use this all the time and never have a problem getting dishes clean. No spots on glassware either. The dishwasher also stays clean.  Great product and very convenient.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I like these pods so much that I put them on my subscription rotation! These pods hold up and don't leave anything behind. I've tried a few other brands but these seem to work best. The scent is clean without actually making the dishes smell like anything is on them. I have found that it's best to make sure the water feeding into the dishwasher is hot to make sure the casings on the pods dissolves completely after one occurrence of some casing being left behind in the dispense but that was only one occurrence out of 365 uses of these pods over the past year. It's also worth noting that Amazon has the best price compared to my local grocers.,positive,dishwashing tablet
