"I've had a Yeti 20 oz double wall mug for 20+ years.  It's my favorite mug becuase it keeps things hot or cold for a long time.  However, the old style lid just had a hole for sipping one's coffee without a cover.  Fairly easy to clean, but build up of coffee grime tends to need periodic cleaning with a brillo pad.  Also, if it tipped over it would spill quite alot - not as much as without the lid, but still enough to be troublesome.  So I bought this unit because of the new magnetic lid.  Its just like the old one (except copper in color) in terms of keeping my coffee hot for a long time and spillage with the lid MagSlider closed spills alot less liquid, but still not ""leak proof"".  Good enough in my book.  Also, I really like that one can remove the MagSlider for cleaning.  I've purchased 20 oz mugs from other manufacturers and they all have problems with cleaning the lid slider area and none of them keep coffee hot for as long as my trust old and copper new mugs.",positive,mug
"Keeps hot stuff hot, cold stuff cold. Not sure for how many hours because it doesn't take me hours to drink the contents. It is NOT leak proof! If it falls over with the sliding magnet in closed position, the liquid inside will STILL LEAK OUT. If said sliding magnet is in open position - you're cleaning up a spill. That last point SHOULD be obvious, but sometimes things need to be explained in am elementary fashion. A bit pricey for just another beverage travel cup, and paying for the Yeti name. I do like that it is easy to clean up by hand if you choose,  but I prefer a dishwasher. I bought this in a rush for a replacement travel cup/mug. I recommend shopping around if you want less costly, and 100% leak-proof is a must.",positive,mug
"It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for.  It does not leak at all, the magnetic slide to open and close the drinking port is brilliant.  I can clean under it with no issues and it does not get gunky like my other coffee mugs that have a plastic slider that is attached to the lid.  I ended up buying two more.",positive,mug
This is my second tumbler from Yeti and it is as great as the one I have already loved. Now I can alternate and have an extra if one is in the dishwasher. Yet they can be put in the dishwasher. Great products. You get what you pay for.,positive,mug
"I love the color, I really love the cup I got the new pink and went to get my sister the new yellow color. We both love them. I want more, and will probably get more later. Go people and get one, the top fits and goes on better than any other cup I have ever had. Your gonna love it… tee",positive,mug
"really easy to clean, looks stylish, keeps my coffee warm for a very long time, and it just feels amazing! if I had to be nitpicky about it, I'd just ask for a detachable rubber ring or something to prevent it slipping, and definitely a completely airtight lid",positive,mug
"I love that the top part comes off to clean and works really well (doesn’t fall off, and slides easy) cup kept my cocoa warm (to warm) for over 4 hours. After that I gave up drinking it because it was to hot! Bought 2 for Christmas presents ended up using during a long power outage. I will be replacing all of our to go cups with these.",positive,mug
"The Good:-Super sturdy-Keeps drinks cold-Easy to clean-StylishThe Bad:-A bit expensive but well builtThe Bottom Line:I use this Yeti Rambler everyday and all day for drinking cold water out of. It is expensive but it looks great and is well built. I like how easy it is to clean since there is no straw or anything with a lot of parts to clean. When the cap is closed it's mostly leak proof but I wouldn't throw it into a bag. Overall, I would recommend this mug for its build quality and style.",positive,mug
"I don't think these are legitimate Yeti products.  I got another Yeti mug in the states are it's a bit different the trademark YETI is much larger and the one I got in the states is in better condition even though it's a lot older.  Check the picture, this shouldn't happen after just a month.  The one I got in the states is on the left, the one I got from this seller is on the right.",negative,mug
"This is without a doubt, the most expensive and most useless mug I have bought. You can’t even fill it with coffee and put it in your cup holder without it leaking everywhere. The clear lid lets you “check the status of your drink” or the more accurate statement “see how much leaks out”  my $9 mig from Walmart outperforms this junk. My girlfriend likes the colour, maybe it can leak all over her car from now on.",negative,mug
"This product looks great and is extremly good at keeping your drinks hot. The reason for the 3/5 star is because the sliding thing on the lid is not air tight which means when I'm walking with the bottle, my coffee is leaking through the drinking slide and making a mess. It is annoying because I have to always make sure the bottle is upright and walk slowly so the slushing inside doesnt cause the coffee to leak through the top.",neutral,mug
"item leaks.  Everywhere. First time I used it - water all over phone and bag.  So its either a knock-off or inferior manufacturing (see reviews of item many mention leaking).  I had a yeti for years I bought from USA and it never leaked a drop. The seal and the slider on this product is completely defective!  To cap it all the seller is dishonourable & dishonest.! When I returned it, the seller deducted 9.86 from my refund because they said ""the item is not defective"" and ""it had been used"".  AVOID. My advice is pay a bit more and get a good and reliable product from a decent trader.  Seller had the temerity to tell me item was not supposed to be watertight.",negative,mug
"Great size cup and it does keep the coffee/tea warm but after only 3 or 4 times of usage, unfortunately, the lid lets this product down.  It's just not fully sealable and leaks.  I'll have to put this down to experience and next time I will go for something much more cheaper and with a screwable lid.",negative,mug
"These mugs are brilliant I made my coffee at 5am and it was still warm at 8am I love it No leak problem and have been using it for quite some time now…. All I would say is, they are very reliable and you wont be sorry",positive,mug
Very comfortable to drink from. Fits in my cup holders. Lockable valve ergonomically positioned. Insulation works better than expected.,positive,mug
I put a cold drink in my cup and it was 110 degrees outside.  I had an appointment and was gone 2 hours.  Came back to my drink and ice was still in the nice icy cold cup.  Great proxy.  I now have two of these and will be making gift for holidays.  I strongly recommend.,positive,mug
"My partners goto coffee mug, attractive, practical and very functional. I have also bought one for my sister. Excellent delivery service (Now our borders are open). These will make great Xmas presents should you be so inclined.",positive,mug
I feel a little stupid  because I was drinking from the wrong end. I actually gave this thing one star because it was leaking from the spout as it turns out I was drinking from the wrong end because it does come out of that end as well but that’s just an air slot the button is behind it and you drink from the other side. I was going to come on to redo my review at the minimum to give it another star because of how hot it keeps thngs. And I’m talking about when the top not even on it it keeps it hot for a long time. But at 9 o’clock in the morning today I made tea I just took the cup and poured it into the sink because I figured that it will be ice cold by now it was actually still lukewarm after all those hours.it’s 603PM PM!!! I was so embarrassed about my review that I had to redo it and erase it completely because I was so obviously wrong but  I’m pretty sure that this is happened to somebody else as well. This is the best one I have ever had. End of story. Nothing is better than us. Mine is blue it is extremely durable and as I said before it keep stuff hot. It’s sealed it completely not one week it is the best one I’ve ever had again I just said that and I’ve had so many different kinds over the years this is by far the best one,positive,mug
"WoW !!! Do these work well. Other than for one tiny negative aspect, I'd give 5 stars.(A+)  Temperature for hot coffee -This keeps my coffee hot for several hours. BTW - I do not like coffee that is too hot, plus I add 2% milk, so when the lid goes on, the coffee has already cooled to some degree. As the first few sips are too hot for my liking, I let the mug sit next to my desk and after 30 to 45 minutes I can begin to drink it somewhat comfortably.  I'm still enjoying my coffee right now 2.5 hours after it was made.(A+)  Leaking -None. Zero. The mug does not leak regardless of when it is locked or not. Of course if unlocked and the button is depressed, well of course it will.When initially cleaning the mug, I tested by filling it with extremely hot water and affixed the lid as instructed. Yes, by turning it first counter-clockwise to allow the lid's threads to drop down (you'll hear this if you listen for it) and engage the metal cylinder's threads before turning it clockwise. This PREVENTS cross-threading which will mess up the lid's threads.  I locked the lid, then inverted the mug and shook the heck out of it - then waited and waited. Not one drop leaked out. Next I repeated by unlocking the lid and again not a single drop. - not from the drink button, nor the lock button, nor at the lid to mug juncture (threads).(A+)  Use -My interest in purchasing this product was to protect my computer equipment. Previously I used a mug that would close off coffee flow, but it definitely was not leak proof. I'm not a cavalier coffee drinker by any means but when near computer equipment I was always concerned I'd spill my coffee. Now?  I'm still cautious, but far less concerned about an accidental spill.CONTIGO - Suggestion -I'd prefer a squatter mug. One with:1. A handle attached to mug at top & bottom of handle2. A different profile, having a very broad bottom and narrow top. This would afford several benefits: better stabilization AND a lower profile to fit under coffee makers.. No taller than 6 inches (lid removed dimension) might be a good limit.(B+)  NEGATIVE -My only negative is on one mug it appears the protective, imprinted, outer plastic wrap was applied too soon after the two ""contigo"" logos were printed on the mug as the plastic wrap bonded to the painted logos. The tiny projecting pieces sticking out from the logos feels a bit uncomfortable.The wrap should not be applied until the logos' paint is fully cured.",positive,mug
"These are very well made travel mugs. They are attractive, beautiful colors, and keep the beverage either hot or cold for a long time. I like the way they feel in your hand.",positive,mug
My wife loves these and this is the third one she has goner through. The only caveat is the finish on the mug tend to wear off after a while and we only hand wash the thing.,positive,mug
Used this for the first time at work the other day. I made a hot tea in it at 9:30 am and went off to the office. Forgot all about it until about 1 pm and it was still super hot - so hot that I took the lid off for about 10 minutes to let it cool down enough for me to drink. Giving 4 stars only because I wish the drink opening was a bit larger. I will continue to use it but I think I'll use it more as a thermos to to keep my tea hot and then just pour what I want to drink into a mug so I don't burn myself!,positive,mug
"These are a must buy if you love having warm drinks and you are time poor. I have both the easy clean and the standard model, I love that you can put them in your bag and not worry about spills. They keep drink hot for about an 1-2 hours and then the temperature lowers after that but not too much (coffee is still drinkable). I adore them for this reason alone, as I have purchased many other travel mugs and thrown out countless dregs of cold coffee because they were useless. I also use these for water. It keeps my water cold for 16 hours.",positive,mug
"I tested 2 Yeti tumblers, a Contigo and this Stanley tumbler.  This one kept the product hot longer than the others. About 2 hours for me.  I like my drinks steaming hot. It also was the slimmest one.  I have small hands and the Yeti Stackable was too big to hold AND the plastic lid did NOT keep the heat in.  The Yeti Rambler 12 oz stainless steel came in 2nd in my opinion.  The Contigo had a good design, easy to hold but did not hold the heat for any length of time.  FYI - I boiled water poured it in each tumbler, took the temperature then waited and checked the temperature every 30 minutes for 3 hours.  This was the only one that kept the temperature refreshingly hot.  NOTE:  it seems that the vast majority of the tumblers now have a lid where a button has to be pushed to release the liquid to drink.  White this is a nuisance, it does work to keep the beverage hotter.",positive,mug
"I got this for my wife as a just because gift. She loves coffee, and she drinks (and spills) quite a bit in her car, so I thought this would be perfect for her. WE LOVE THESE STANLEY MUGS! They are durable and so easy to wash! It is so handy to be able to wash these in the dishwasher. The lid also comes apart so that each piece can be deep cleaned. They are also sealed at the top at the spout and the base of the lid, so they do not leak easily. Very happy with this purchase.",positive,mug
Using since last few weeks (Nov 2022) and worked as described. Nothing special about this mug. Just my suggestion - Keep its upper portion clean all the time. It's using springs and some mechanical process to release the hot or cold water. So in case you are drinking herbal or tea leaves better to keep clean. I had issue in begining and its start leaking from release button. Overall it's a great mug and I would recommend. Enjoy ...!!!,positive,mug
"This is a replacement for my old thermos cup/mug, of a similar but older design.This one works just as well as the old! So far, it keeps my coffee hot-hot-hot for 6 hours or so, which is when I usually start sipping on it. Of COURSE it starts to cool a little after that, as I'm breaking the seal and constantly exposing it to cool air, but in the 2 or 3 hours it takes me to finish off my coffee, it's still really hot, just not fresh-out-of-the-pot hot as when I start drinking it.As for reviewers talking about the plastic taste....do you people thoroughly WASH new drink ware you purchase? I mean, REALLY wash it?I took the lid apart, even the rubber O-ring, and ran it through the dishwasher. Lo and behold, NO PLASTIC TASTE when I put it together and used it! If you don't have a dishwasher,  then still take it apart completely, soak it in clean, soapy water for a few minutes, agitate it around, then brush clean it and rinse the heck out of it.I'll almost guarantee that's why people are complaining about the plastic taste...it may be NEW, but it NEEDS TO BE WASHED thoroughly BEFORE you start using it!The new design of the lid...I'm not sure yet if it's an improvement. It doesn't seem to be any more or less sturdy than the old design, so I'll have to see if it holds up. If it breaks, trust me, I'll update here. My last thermos cup lasted for 8 years of constant use, so if this one breaks before THAT one...I'll be quite unhappy...but it doesn't seem like I should have any issues.",positive,mug
"I bought this mug in blue for my husband’s birthday, and I liked his so much that I had to buy my own. We were using Contigo mugs because we preferred the trigger action to keep our coffee from spilling and help hold in the heat. However they were hard to clean since they didn’t come apart in the lid, and the gaskets and trigger would grow mold. This Stanley mug’s trigger twists out for full access to thoroughly clean the lid and trigger. Also, liquids stay hot for hours and hours. I already have had one friend purchase this mug from Amazon after she saw mine.",positive,mug
"Keeps hot drinks hot for hours. Haven’t tried any cold drinks, yet. Great like my classic Stanley thermos. Easy to take apart and give a thorough cleaning. My wife says it’s kind of big and tall, but I love it. Would buy again, when needed.",positive,mug
"This travel mug is amazing! It kept my coffee hot for almost 8 hours, hot not warm! It is so worth the investment if you are looking for something durable, easy to clean, drip proof and keeps the hot hot and the cold cold!",positive,mug
"this travel mug is great for carrying hot or cold drinks in cars and does not require too much preconditioning like adding hot water before it keeps drinks hot, or adding iced water before it keeps cold drinks cold. You can pour the hot or cold drink right away. It will keep them at the temperature they are at, for a few hours. It saves a lot of time and hassle. Today, when everyone is on the go, all the time, especially.",positive,mug
"When it comes to keeping your drinks hot could not ask for anything better, without pre-heating it kept my coffee hot for well over 9hours (recommend letting drink cool if you want to drink it within 3hrs)The lid has 3 main parts to dismantle which could of been designed better, the screw that holds the lid together has a hole which has no function keeping day old coffee in, other parts of the lid also has lots of small spaces to keep residue of coffee which is near impossible to shift, I recently started to get bad smells from the cup, which after lots of investigation turned out to be coming from the button, as it turns out when you slightly press the button to release pressure (as per manual) it also takes with it a small portion of the contents of the cup, which can not be reached to be cleaned.Only after dismantling the button did I discover the months old coffee and mold, I have always filled the cup only to the line and soaked all the parts of the lid for cleaning as instructed but obviously there are parts that are not covered in cleaning and with movement particles of liquid will get in the button.my advice is if you fancy the risk of losing the smallest gasket in the world, take the button apart and clean it all the time, otherwise the cup is only good for keeping water in.I have since lost the spring and gasket and contacted the manufacturer who not only replaced the missing parts but sent me a whole new lid also at no cost, and after trial and error it's lid is quite robust and couldn't be happier with my cup, I now make coffee and add a little cold water when making so it will be at a drinkable temperature a few hours later",positive,mug
These are the best mugs in the world! Love them. They keep your coffee warm for hours inside and outside. Spill proof so can chuck in your bag without worrying. The lid mechanism does temd to wear after a long time but the plus side is you can contact stanley direct and as they have a life long gaurantee you can get a free replacement lid. They have recently changed the style of lid since i bought this so might break less easily. I had my flas k for years before the lid button lost it's spring.  Wpuld highly recommend. Also they are pretty much dent proof as well. Solid.,positive,mug
"I like that it holds coffee. Without it, the coffee would burn me. Before this mug, I would dump out my coffee into my hand and try and slurp it up. I have had to go to the hospital due to my burns. I had never tasted coffee before this mug. I can confirm... coffee tastes like butt.",positive,mug
"One of the only travel mugs I’ve found that can hold a big 20oz coffee and still be slim enough to fit in a cars cup holder. Doesn’t leak at all, keeps drinks hot for hours, trigger mechanism disassembles easily to clean. Solid sturdy build. Very happy with my purchase.",positive,mug
"I was bought this as a Christmas present by my husband who has an identical mug in a hammered green finish which works really well.  I've used it approximately 10 times since Christmas and it's not kept my drink hot for more than an hour and a half on every occasion.  I've ended up with cold tea after 2 hours.  Although I'm not sure if it's something to do with the fact that it was lobbed over our fence by the delivery driver and arrived with a small dent, I would have a expected better performance.",negative,mug
"Pros:1. Does not leak.2. Rugged exterior.3. Thermos brand, very popular.Cons:1. The ""OPEN"" and ""CLOSE"" has white text on black back, and between the two it's hard to tell what it is set at. I wish they would use a more obvious display like a shape (thinking like on a remote control for play and stop) and/or maybe a different color for each.2. I wish the top color matched the cup color. My wife uses cream and sugar in her coffee and it can leave an aftertaste so I avoid missing the tops. I used her white nail polish and made two dots on the lid for my silver cup so I knew which was which, her cup is blue (but the lids are all silver).3. The handle kind of gets in the way of my cup holder in my car. I will get one without a handle for mobile purposes.I definitely I will buy more of these.I paid $23.19 for the silver one and $24.99 for a blue one.",positive,mug
"This is the best travel mug we have found for keeping coffee hot ALL DAY!  When husband lost his, he tried the other mugs we own, but they didn't compare.  Had to order another of the Thermos brand for him!",positive,mug
"My previous travel mug, also of the same make and model, was getting a bit worn, and needed a replacement. I did not hesitate to order the same one from Thermos/Amazon. The only difference this time is a plain stainless steel exterior, which I think is far superior to my previous mug in Midnight Blue, which chipped and scratched easily.Doesn’t splash, doesn’t leek, holds my coffee or tea’s temps for hours. And the handle makes it easy to carry. Easy to clean too, which is a plus.Helpful hint: the interior and other internal parts will eventually get stained. Do not use chlorine bleach, or any cleaners that contain bleach. It will damage the steel. Use denture cleaning tablets instead. They may need a few hours of soaking, but you can rest easy knowing there will be no chemical damage done. Avoid abrasive cleaners as well. These can scratch the surfaces and cause increased staining.",positive,mug
"After leaving my original one in a hotel room, I tried to go cheap with another brand. But it fell short in so many ways that I ended up ponying up the ridiculous price for this one. It keeps coffee hot forever, it does in just about any cup holder, the handle is convenient, and I like that you can disassemble it to give it a thorough cleaning in the dishwasher. It is unfortunate that it is about $15 too expensive, but they do what they do better than anyone else.",positive,mug
"perfect size, keeps coffee warm all day. Easy close/open valve. love the handle",positive,mug
"After reading recent reviews on this, I'm compelled to take a moment to relay my pleasure with this product, and counter some of the reported downsides.First:  Apparently the marketing dept. actually listened, and they aren't using the terrible stickers from Hades to cover the outside of the cup any longer.  They are now using the brittle shrink-wrapped plastic, with a perforation down the side (similar to what is used on those glass-bottle cold coffee drinks from that major coffee chain, or some ice cream lids, or some vitamin bottles) , which made it easy to take off the outside advertising.  Heck, even the two UPC codes on the bottom of the cup practically came off like old-school colorforms - zero residue.I ordered the plain stainless steel one, so I can't comment on the paint chipping/peeling issues some noted (sure, it might be quality control, or maybe it's exacerbated/caused by dishwasher detergents?).  I can say that mine came without a dent or scratch on it.  Maybe I'm lucky?  I'm sure I'll put some on it soon anyway, since I'm a bit clumsy (and why, apart from this mug, I just can't have nice things).The handle seems plenty sturdy, and yes, the internals on the lid have a few extra pieces.  Taking the lid apart to wash and putting it back together is fairly easy, and the opening on the lid lines up 90 degrees from the handle.  While it's certainly possible some lids might be defective/improperly aligned/mated, it appears more likely to me that maybe some folks aren't tightening the lid just right?.  I can't argue against the folks that are having problems; I can just state that mine is easy to align and the sipping hole is where it should be when the lid is fastened casually/normally.Making sure the lid is 'open' prior to screwing it on seems to help minimize any chance of overflow, or resistance while tightening the lid.  On mine, it does not remotely require Herculean effort to tighten or remove the lid to have the drinking hole line up properly, and the lid be leak-free.I use my cup daily, and since my last one (different brand) lasted well over 10 years, this mug appears built well and should last at least that long (but it's nice that it has a 5 year warranty, just in case).",positive,mug
"Another quality thermos product. I have one for cold,one for hot drinks. Both work remarkabley well keeping temperatures in ""as delivered"" ranges",positive,mug
"A little pricey but a great leakproof mug that has saved my car rug from spills several times when the mug has accidentally been knocked over. It keeps beverages hot or cold as desired longer than any other mug I have had. Great customer service. I prefer the Thermos mug with a handle but after a few years of use both of my mugs have had issues with the handle. The centerpiece of the handle on the first mug had become dislodged, then lost during use. The handle on the second mug is now extremely wobbly with no apparent way to tighten it.",positive,mug
"I am obsessed with this tumbler. As others have mentioned, you do need to take the lid apart when cleaning, but it’s super simple. Not once have I felt inconvenienced for having to take one extra step to make sure the lid is clean. And my coffee stays hot for HOURS. I’m honestly considering getting a second one just so I have two in the rotation. Totally recommend this thermos!",positive,mug
The cups are great except on the colored ones the paint chips off very quickly and looks awful. However they still keep the product nice and warm.,positive,mug
"I bought this as a gift for a friend. They were in need of a travel mug that doesn't leak, spill or lid pop off in their car. This was exactly what they needed and were very happy to receive it.",positive,mug
"Convenient, functions well and stylish. Owned many before , all worked well except my last purchase, the lid doesn’t click when opening and closing , it doesn’t leak but can be confusing sometimes.",positive,mug
Leaks after 2 weeks not worth the price cannot get to work again junk,positive,mug
"This thermos is a great thermos to put cold or hot and it holds for hours, no leaks, and it feels good on the lips, and it doesn't over pour  when you're going to take a sip...The handle is soothing to the hand and you're able to grip it with all four fingers, not just two or three fingers, the handle is very nice, and you could hook your thermos to anything.Recommend this thermos cup.",positive,mug
Great product. I have purchased several coffee mugs/traveling cups within the last year and I can say I was currently pleased with this one. Secure and doesnt leak....keeps coffee hot as advertised.,positive,mug
Great thermos mug,positive,mug
Absolutely love this mug .,positive,mug
I am enjoying my thermos coffee mug.  The open/close feature is a plus because I can drink from either side.  Love the handle feature.,positive,mug
"Over the years I owned a lot of thermos products and this one lives up to my expectations. It holds ice cold water for hours. I'll fill it up before going to bed and after 8 hours it is still cold :)I haven't tried it with hot fluids. Comfortable handle, easy to clean. It won't spill if you make sure not to fill it over the line that's inside the mug. One thing that I don't like is that the top is completely round. If you try to drink it in the darkness you won't know where to put your mouth and can potentially burn yourself. A little dip in the rim would do the trick. Also, there are 2 ""open"" spots but they are not in the middle or the sides. They're really close to the handle which makes it very strange to drink from. I wish I could turn it about quarter turn more then it would be easier to use (especially in the dark because I would know without looking where the opening is)",positive,mug
"I've been using this for a while now. It's great as it truly does not leak and keeps my coffee warm for hours. However, the lid is now giving me problems. When trying to open, the lid just spins and spins and does not open after many tries. And if I put it in the dishwasher, it does not get cleaned properly, and it smells. I will have to use a small spout cleaning brush or something to get at it.Update: I contacted thermos directly and they are sending me a replacement lid. Great and fast customer service.",neutral,mug
"You most certainly get what you pay for.  I don't like my hot drinks boiling, so it takes me about 5 hours before I can drink it.  Great for those who like to have their taste buds burnt off.Always stays cold to the touch.  Yes, the colours scratch off easily, but I don't care about that at all.  It's exactly what it says it will do.As other have said:  the flavour sticks to the thermos.  So I have one for herbal teas, and one for coffee.",positive,mug
"It kept my coffee hot for almost a whole shift.Drinkable temperature the whole shift.I cycle to work, even when it is cold.The bicycle drink holder already, on the first trip, scratched the paint. It would be better, in the long run, if the mug was not painted. This is a common issue with thermos mugs. My older mug, a 3-4 years old, looks awful due to all the scratched paint.",positive,mug
"Lid is threaded on the outside. You either wait forever for your coffee to cool down ( so you don’t burn your lip) or you take the lid off and drink your coffee.  #2. There is a rubber gasket inside that swells from heat allowing you to leak coffee down your chest. Otherwise, it’s a good cup.",positive,mug
"I've used a Snap Seal tumblers now for around 3 years.  The best thing is that they are truly leak proof.  When the drink port is closed, the pressure relief hole is also closed.  I have tossed these tumblers in my backpack upside-down and am comfortable doing it.  The tumbler's rim is smooth, so I think the lid's o-ring should always seat properly.  The drink port seal seats from the inside, so if pressure builds (from hot liquid heating up the air space after closing) it should seal more tightly.You need a strong index finger to open the drink port it with one hand while holding the tumbler in drinking position, but if you don't have a strong finger, you can open it one-handed if you reposition your hand.What I like least is that the top surface of the lid is flush with the rim, so there's no place for one's nose when one tips the tumbler up for a drink.  Lots of these mugs are designed that way.  That's why the promotional pictures always show the models holding the tumbler in their hand instead up to their mouth for a drink.  To drink, I have to tilt my head way back like a chicken looking at falling rain.  (I don't know why the designers don't just move the top surface down an inch or so to make space for one's nose.)It seems to insulate as well as other items of the same price range, which is fine for my use but well below the inflated numbers all manufacturers claim.  I use the tumbler as a drinking vessel, not a storage vessel.  If I don't start drinking, my half-full container of coffee can remain scalding hot for an hour or so.  But once I start drinking, it cools down fast and gives me only about 45 minutes to finish my coffee.I think performance numbers and anecdotes that consumers post on the web for these products are meaningless without a detailed description of the experimental procedure.  For example, the life time of ice cubes depends a lot on whether the cubes are immersed in water.  The amount of liquid in the tumbler and whether you're actively drinking also strongly affects how long it maintains temperature.  Just beware while comparing numbers.",positive,mug
Love this brand in travel mugs,positive,mug
The inner seal has issues. You have to make sure it’s in properly or there will be leaks,positive,mug
"I refuse to drink coffee out of a coffee mug that isn't vacuum insulated. I just refuse! So let's get to this mug, and I'll briefly compare it with a $20 Thermos I've been using for the last 18 months.**What's right with this mug**- ELEGANT DESIGN. I happen to know from the industry--and you can tell I'm right because look at all the various different, weird drink bottles and mug tops on the market--that it's basically the Holy Grail of drink container tops to have them seal *well* with one finger. A little snap is easy, but doesn't seal tightly. Look at Contigo's Autoseal technology (different mug). It's absurd. Look how complex that is. Look at Thermos' tech on one of their bottles; I have one of their mugs that has FIVE parts to it I have to wash--and that's just the top! It's lunacy. Absolute insanity. The Contigo Snapseal has ONE moving part (physically made up of three parts total, but they all stay together) and is dishwasher safe with NO disassembly! It is a one-finger function, and it seals tight enough to shake the thing upside down without leakage. Now, I wouldn't put anything in a backpack that doesn't have a conventional screw cap, but this wasn't something somebody worked on for 20 minutes and put in production. A lot of thought went into it- CHEAP. This is among the cheapest vacuum insulated coffee mugs on Amazon- FITS UNDER KEURIG if 16 oz (confirmed)- WIDE BOTTOM. This doesn't taper up from a V-shape like other bottles, so is somewhat more stable**What's wrong with this mug**- BIG problem is it has a very small hole. If you like to guzzle coffee fast this hole won't work for you. My wife hated it because of this. I personally like to sip it slowly and for me it works perfectly fine- SMALL (possibly not real) problem is it seems to lose heat through the top faster than I'd like. All mugs like this have plastic, un-insulated tops, but I'm under the totally unscientific impression it feels hotter than my Thermos did--------------I bought the Gunmetal color and there doesn't appear to be any paint that will flake off. Some people have complained about burning upper lips. I haven't noticed this at all. As I said I am a coffee sipper, though. I don't guzzle it, and it comes out of the hole very well. I would buy another one of these for sure.If I have any major issues with this I'll come back and review it, as I always do for things.",positive,mug
"I filled this cup with hot water as a test.  One first notices that compared to other travel mugs - this retains the heat inside the cup and the outside does not feel hot at all which is a good sign.5 hours later I went back and the water was still hot not steaming and piping hot as when it went in but definitely as hot as I would like my coffee to be and after 5 hours it will more than do the job as I just need my coffee to stay hot from 7.55am until around 10.30-11.00am.Also I can confirm that when you tip it upside down it does not leak.  The instructions are a useful read, they recommend to let the liquid stand in the mug for about 2-3 minutes before screwing the lid on and they also recommend having the sip hole open while doing this.  I must say I am very impressed.If I feel there is more to be said after a few weeks of using this, I will update this review.  But I'm impressed!",positive,mug
"My husband has had this exact cup for 18 months (bought from Tesco) with no problems - best travel cup he's ever had he says. Just bought another as a replacement as his previous one is battered and bruised. Bought from SUPERMARKET USA through Amazon and it is not fit for purpose. The inner rubber band seal keeps coming loose from the lid (handwashed) and seems to have stretched after less than five weeks of use so will no longer stay put and cannot be drunk from without spilling down your shirt. SUPERMARKET USA are not interested and have closed my return request because we're 'outside of the return period'. FIVE WEEKS. If you're happy to pay the best part of £15 for a cup that lasts a few weeks then go ahead and purchase (you might get lucky and get a good one but I'm not the only reviewer to complain about the seal) because if it fails more than a few weeks after receiving it you won't be able to return it. SUPERMARKET USA, your customer service is appalling. FYI, if you're near a larger Tesco, they sell these 16oz cups for £12 and you don't have to wait four weeks for it to be delivered.",negative,mug
"Love Contigos - I carry mine everywhere, have done for nearly 6 years now! Bought this one for my sister-in-law who recently had a baby. Allows you to safely sip a hot drink whilst breastfeeding. And brilliant when baby starts to crawl as it's safe to have a cup of tea around them. Oh, she also uses it on the school run with her older kids! Finally, mums get to finish a cup of tea whilst still hot, even if that takes 2 hours!Saving money and helping the planet. No single-use cups needed. Hurrah!",positive,mug
Spot on. Its the 2nd one I've bought. I thought I'd lost my first one so bought this as a replacement then found my original. They keep your drink nice and hot for about 5-6hours before starting to cool quite rapidly. Only downside is the rubber seal tends to twist and dislodge meaning you need to ensure its fully fitted before reattaching the lid. Other than that its great.,positive,mug
"Most of the time the seal is good but it is very thin and can be easily dislodged from its grove. Keeps coffee warm for ages. Spending this much on a mug, I expect better quality.",negative,mug
"These use to be more expensive so trying them wasn’t a good idea.Man! Should have bought it sooner.Love the design, easy to clean, easy to use and it has the lip cover.Did I mention the lip cover? My favorite feature to keep things hygienic.Will buy more.",positive,mug
"I love this travel mug! No spill, no leak. I have to say the strongest feature is that it stays cold longer than I expected. I have put ice in it at 4pm and at 9:30am the next morning there’s still ice! Hot beverages stat hot for about 3.5 hours. I would definitely recommend this travel cup!",positive,mug
Leak proof and keeps hot beverages hot for a good while. Down side is that cleaning the mug you’re going to need a brush as it’s narrow and you won’t be able to get your hand inside,positive,mug
"I love this coffee mug. I feel like it's a premium coffee tumbler with all the bells and whistles plus it looks great! I've put it in the dishwasher every weekday for about a month and it's holding up fine. The logo and other note on the bottom of the cup is peeling off but that's not a big deal to me. I use dishwasher pods, which are more harsh. I do depress the button and shake after washing to let excess water clear the little part that other ppl have seen mold trapped in. So far that's been clean looking to me.Only thing to note:Water sounds like it's trapped in the bottom of the mug somehow. I shake and it makes noise but no water flies out anywhere.. There's gotta be some dishwasher water in there but if it's not flying out then I guess it's okay...? I know it's not but so far it's not caused me any issues. Even if it molds, if it doesn't leak then I'm not sure if that matters?Would buy again but waiting to see if I get any mold issues anywhere or if the cap breaks. I've been gentle with the cap and can remove it easily without prying it off.",positive,mug
Only kept it nicely hot for an hour then quickly cooled off.  I returned it purchased a Stanley Trigger Action Travel Mug that I love.,neutral,mug
best of the market,positive,mug
"I wanted someone to compare these two different Contigo cups when I was purchasing, but no one had compared them; so now I’ll do it.  The “Transit” model is prettier in my opinion.  The twirling cover is a nice feature.  But  sadly, I don’t like it as much as the “west loop” model.  It’s about the mouth piece.  With the “transit” model, you have to slurp to get your drink into your mouth.  With the “west loop” you just tilt and suck it in.  No slurping.That being said, I bought these mugs so I can drink Mio flavored water without my kids knowing I have flavored water in there.  I have only drank cold beverages from these.  If, however, I was going to drink something hot (hot chocolate), the slurping from the “transit” might be better because it would allow me to test the heat with my upper lip prior to drinking.  I don’t think the “west loop” would allow this as well and one might be more likely to burn one’s mouth.I purchased 2 “west loop” contigos after my initial trial of the two cups.  Size wise, I’ve really liked the smaller 16oz over the slightly larger 20 oz.  It fits under my fridge tap better than the larger size. The 20 oz is fine as well, but it’s a little harder to see what I’m doing when filling it because it doesn’t quite fit and has to be tilted to go under the fridge tap.  Hope this helps!I have used the flip up straw contigos for years, but I have doubt that I actually prefer the “west loop” mug even for drinking water over the straw versions.  The reason is because I felt like I had to unscrew lid on the flip top straw Contigo a little in order to not have to work at getting a drink of water because of the seal on the flip tops doesn’t allow enough air, so I would have to suck really hard if I didn’t vent the lid.  The “west loop” mug just does what I like better.",positive,mug
"It's a bit shorter than I expected it to be, but as it holds more than I thought it would. I was able to make a pint of hot chocolate which has lasted all morning without going cold.The lid comes apart so it makes it easier to clean for having so many moving parts in it. The grey part on the lid covers the hole to drink out of, and you also need to hold the button on the lid down to drink out of it, so that makes it pretty foolproof when it comes to leaks.Plus it's pretty sitting on my desk too!It took a while to arrive, but if this one broke, I'd order another one.",positive,mug
The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars it’s because the black colour is very easy to remove and scratch after a couple of washes.Get the stainless steel one and you won’t have a problem,negative,mug
"This is not a pack of 2, it’s just one, but still good for the price.It doesn’t keep my coffee as warm as the original style and the supply part is harder to get used to, but I do still love this cup.  It looks nice, has a non slip, easy grip rubber surrounding and can be carried in my handbag without fear of it leaking.",neutral,mug
"Similar to another reviewer, I ordered the Stainless Steel variant which says it's a '2-Pack' but received only one mug.The one I did receive is pretty good - keeps hot drinks hot, is easy to hold/grip and fits car cup holders and rucksack pockets well.  Just note if you're only getting one, it's not as good a price it suggests.",neutral,mug
"So pleased I made this purchase. One of the best reusable hot drinks cups I've come across. Easily holds a medium coffee shop sized drink, and keeps it hot for hours. I use mine every day.The spring-loaded drinking mechanism makes it so practical for drinking on the move. You don't have to faff around with unscrewing a lid, and it perfectly replicates the lid on plastic takeaway cups.It's easy to clean too, with no unnecessary fiddly bits. Would strongly recommend as a plastic free solution to enjoying takeaway hot drinks.",positive,mug
