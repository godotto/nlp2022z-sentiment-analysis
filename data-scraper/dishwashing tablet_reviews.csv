"I put zero thought into the brand/type of my dish soap until I met my current curmudgeonly machine. My previous dishwashers were no spring chickens either and yet always worked fine with whatever was on sale, so I never even realized detergent could make such a difference. I thought I was just doomed to handwashing until I tried pods instead of liquid once on a whim and got much better results. After a bit more experimenting, my quest for perfectly clean, spot-free dishes finally ended here!Although I tried several other pods that initially showed promise, they were just too unreliable. The ones that were wrapped in plastic were especially problematic for me, as the exterior often failed to fully melt, even on the hottest water setting. That's a non-issue with these pods though. They're just little blocks of concentrated powder that dissolve completely and evenly each time. Every dish gets washed thoroughly without fail whether I vigorously rinse them or not, and there's never any soapy residue.I've been happily using these pods for months and have had no further issues. They really work miracles in my finicky, old machine, so I can only imagine what they can do in newer technology!",positive,dishwashing tablet
We put this in and haven't stopped using it since. It truly does make a difference and after years of not using them we could clearly see the difference after even 1 use.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These are the best dishwasher tabs I've used, but I am also happy the come in a cardboard box. The cardboard box mix them easy to store and I am glad they don't come in a big dumb plastic tub.Nice product.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I like the product and it does it’s job. I dislike the fact that the tablets are encased and you have to open it up before you can use it. Why not encase them in a dissolving encasement if they have to be encased.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I literally cannot find these foul wrapped tablets at any store near me.  I don't like the plastic dissolvable wrapped ones as the plastic doesn't dissolve completely and is very gooey so I only use these foil wrapped tablets.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great especially on aluminum items compared to Cascade. I wish they would go back to the gelatin wrapped tabs to minimize on needless one time use metallic plastic.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Great value. Been looking for the tablets that can be removed from packaging and these are the best!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These tablets are a good value for dishwasher detergent.  Individually wrapped, super easy to unwrap and either toss in dishwasher or place in detergent dispenser.  They work fine either way.  Dishes come clean and usually without any hard water spots.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I use these to help scrub off char on my pans as long as the pan itself is not too oily. For fatty, oily or dishes with egg yolk, I go with Finish Quantum.These are cheap so I sometimes throw one of these into the washer for short wash cycle instead of the detergent compartment for half-load washes.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Have bought this before for about 15$US per box of 94 tablets, which is great value.  Packaging may be torn etc, but the product still works.  4 stars for product performanceHowever, I noticed that the SGD price is now 400% higher than before.  What I can't understand is that the same product is priced at 15$USD on Amazon.com, but 400% higher at Amazon.sg!  The price difference across markets is almost akin to scalping!  Overall 1 star now for crazy pricing inconsistency",positive,dishwashing tablet
"The box arrived in good condition and individual packet has no issue but, it become Powderly once open the individual packet. And I prefer the thin layer of self dissolve plastic cover as do not need to peel off before place it into dishwasher. Overall not bad as a cheaper deal",positive,dishwashing tablet
"All the tablets are individually wrapped, which is a plus because most of them have been damaged and are in crumbs. The box itself seems a little worse for wear, and the tablets are not uniformly made. I wonder if these are original Finish products.",negative,dishwashing tablet
it seems to clean my  crusty pan with just a tiny little dot of crusty bit left... so far so good! Only thing i dun quite like is having to remove the plastic wrapper and at times the tab is all broken and crumbly and powdery inside. hmmm...,positive,dishwashing tablet
I love the finish quantum they always do a super Duper good job never leaves streaks or my glasses looking filmy I will always pay the extra money to get the quantum and if you can’t go for quantum at least get anything by finish also it pays to wash your dish washer machine out at least once a month with the finish’s product for that it’s in the same aisle and it’ll say cleans the dishwasher out from all the lime and grime that gets in there it’s very inexpensive and that helps to get your dishes cleaner as well,positive,dishwashing tablet
"We have used all different types of dishwasher detergents -- powders, gels, and tablets. And different brands. But when we got a new dishwasher, the person who installed the dishwasher recommended this. I wish there was a way I could thank him.  Super easy to use and does a great job. Started purchasing from Amazon because this package had a larger quantity of tabs than what was usually available in the stores. Have become a fan of these. Great product.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Cleans the dishes so I don't have to. Hardest part is figuring out what in the world Finish is doing with all their different ""versions"" of the same product and incredibly underwhelming information available here and on their website to make an informed decision.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These clean my dishes really well. I love the gel packs, because they dissolve easier than the other brand that uses solid packs. The solids don’t melt down as easily, and seem to not get my dishes as clean. I found these on sale, so I bought them. I’m always looking for a good product at a good price, and I found that here.I hope this review helps you make a decision on your purchase.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I used powdered dish washer detergent for years and had issues with surface scratching.  When I bought a new Thermador dish washer, the included documentation recommended this detergent.  It works.  Dishes come out clean and there hasn't been any residue buildup in the machine.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great for my hard water region, leaves glasses spotless.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Make sure you read the instructions because you don't have to unwrap the pellet. Seems to get dishes as clean is the previous Finish pellets.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I moved to a city with particularly bad hard water. Dishwashing pacs that normally wouldn't be an issue were leaving an embarrassingly large amount of powdery residue behind on my dishes. My apartment's dishwasher is also on the older side which may not be helping the situation, but these pacs worked wonders in keeping my dishes free of residue.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I have used this since 2019 and decided to see how much it had gone up.  A crazy $4 in 12 months!  Inflation at a high inflation rate off  8% is $2.  What’s with the crazy greed??  There are other ecological conscious products out there that are just as good or better.  Last time I will contribute to 7th Gen.  Look around before you buy!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Highly recommend packs for your dishwasher. I normally use two packs with other expensive name brands. Using just one pack, my dishes were clean and no spots on the plastic containers! No odor either! Open up dishwasher after the wash, and it smells like water! Love it!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I do not usually use this brand of cleaning products, but I’m sold now! I have had a dishwasher since around 1960, and this is hands-down the best dishwasher detergent I’ve ever used! I am terribly allergic to fragrances and can’t imagine why anyone would want to scent their dishes. When our regular dishwashing detergent ceased to be made, I had to find a replacement that was unscented. These seemed to be the only product left on the market without a fragrance, so I tried them. To my surprise, we have the cleanest dishes we’ve ever had—even using a normal cycle with a full load of dishes and pots and pans. Highly recommend!",positive,dishwashing tablet
These are natural and work well. I only rinse the large food off of my dishes and these pods do the job. I like that they are natural and don’t contain all the fake coloring that some do.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These dishwasher packets are wonderful! I will continue to use this product for as long as they carry them. There is no harsh chemical scent! Cascade and several others that we previously used leave their scents and tastes in children’s cups even after rinsing. These clean our dishes well, leave glass looking great, without a rinse aid, and do not make me worry I’m slowly poisoning my children. The only thing I learned is this product is far less expensive to buy from the grocery store, when it’s in stock.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"For dishwasher detergent, my family tried several brands and finally chose to go with Seventh Generation. We used it at home for daily glassware, stainless steel dinner set and porcelains. For other brands, both glassware and porcelains still felt sticky even after extra cleanse cycles. Seventh Generation left nothing staying with our glasses, cups and dinnerware.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I bought these because they were a Prime Day deal. They are okay but not as good as cascade. I got a cloudy film like other reviews noted, but milder than their. it went away when I started running our dishwasher on “heavy” rather than “normal.”  So, if you find these pods are cheaper and you don’t mind running your dishwasher on a higher setting, these pods will work fine. Don’t expect to be impressed though.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Love that I can clean my family’s dishes with “clean” products.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The green liquid is dried out / leaks*; it's overpriced for the amount you get; and, unless you use really hot water the powder doesn't dissolve.* Whomever had the bright idea (at Palmolive) to add a liquid inside of a plastic pouch that dissolves in water should be fired...Other than that, it's unscented and very sudsy and all of the dishes are spotless.I would probably buy again (but it depends on the compatible price point to other products) -- I don't care about the green stuff - since it was hard to say if it did anything. I am storing them in a plastic container rather than the bag they came in because of the leaking.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I forgot to  took a picture but when I opened the bag and found tiny spider was dead in the bag.But how …?I like this product because no scented and no white tear marks dishes and inside dishwasher but if I find other better one , I will switch because this product always leaking green liquid .",positive,dishwashing tablet
Lack of added fragranceCleanse effectively also,positive,dishwashing tablet
"So far, so good. Dishes are really clean.  We use soft water. I am not sure how it would clean using hard water",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I tried this once because it was cheap on sale. Surprisingly, it’s awesome. It actually works equal to or better than most of the other, more expensive brands I’ve used. Also, it doesn’t have an overpowering scent of fake nature, and what little scent it does have doesn’t bother me. I’ve kept buying this after that one cheap on sale purchase, because it’s still cheaper per wash than most other brands and works great.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Usually use cascade gel and more recently cascade tablets.  While the tablets clean well, they leave a strong detergent smell on everything, especially on my dishwasher safe food storage containers (plastics hold smells better it seems).  The lemon scent cascade is less strong than their ‘fresh’ scent, but it was still annoying to smell and sometimes taste detergent on the food i kept in those containers.Discovered the palmolive unscented tabs here, just did a load in the dishwasher - cleans just as well as cascade, and just as importantly, does not leave the smell of detergent on what was washed!!!  This will be my new brand!  Well done, palmolive - well done…3/6/22 UPDATE - so like one of the other reviewers, i've recently received two orders of the 60 pack size (at least a few months apart) where the small green liquid 'wings' portion of each pod has burst open, dried up or leaked out into the bag.  maybe amazon hasn't been storing these properly and they're sensitive to heat?  i've still be using them, and so far doesn't seem to clean less effectively, but time will tell.  i've e-mail palmolive about it, to see if it matters or if it can be avoided somehow.  assuming they respond, i'll post their response.4/9/22 update - ok, probably too much time spent on dishwashing tablets, but final update (probably) - palmolive responded about a week after an email, they asked for purchase info, lot #, etc, said they’d look into it.  They basically said that without the little green liquid sides the tabs still work fine, just not as well.  I asked, but they didn’t tell me specifically what the green liquid in the ‘wings’ section does, just gave me some marketing speak about the tablets effectiveness in general.  Anyway, in my own experience, i’ve noticed that the tabs that don’t have the green liquid MAYBE don’t wash quite as well (had 1 or 2 instances of some tiny bits of dried food stuck on even after the wash), but for the most part, the tabs still work, as they noted.  In any case, this hasn’t deterred me from keeping this as my go to dishwashing product, and i give credit to them for being responsive.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Bought for work,neutral,dishwashing tablet
"So, I'm not the pac kinda girl. I prefer liquid detergent because it's less expensive. But I had some Amazon credits and decided to treat myself. I am quite surprised. These work so well. My glasses and plates come out sparkling. Although I always use the high heat setting, I'd think these work just as well with shorter cycles.However, I also have a second dishwasher. A countertop one because my floor model died during the pandemic and my superintendent wasn't quick to respond. In THAT machine, these are a waste because a smaller dishwasher doesn't need as much detergent as it uses much less water. So I wouldn't spend my own money on these for that reason.I've got about 20 left but I wouldn't spend my own money on these. I'll stick with Palmolive liquid gel. Less expensive and does the job 🤷‍♀️",positive,dishwashing tablet
"The supply chain delayed my regular dishwashing detergent, so I ordered this product. Let's be honest. It's not what I am used to so there was an adjustment. My dishes didn't sparkle but they were clean you know what I mean. It did the job but not THE JOB I'm used to with other name brands. My regular dishwashing product arrived and I'm keeping this great-value product on the side in case of emergencies or if I have son dishes that just need a little light gentle washing? I recommend this if you have a tight budget and dishes and glasswear that don't need heavy duty washing.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Like the smell,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I live in Las Vegas, which has EXTREMELY hard water (calcium/lime) and a lot of these ""dissolving"" pack wrappers either don't dissolve, or worse, turn into a kind of glue that can jam the detergent hatch shut (run a cleaning cartridge through if that happens to you).  This particular brand seems to work well, has no particular odor that I can detect, and the pouch dissolves every time.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I have tried a few dishwasher soaps of similar type of dishwasher soaps and found the items come-out with a cleaner with no residual film. I would recommend the product!.,positive,dishwashing tablet
This is the best dishwasher soap I've used. It never leaves soap residue on clean dishes.,positive,dishwashing tablet
They work they do the job well,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great and like non toxic ordered again,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works great. I really like clean dishes that don’t smell like strong detergent.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I was looking for a less toxic dishwasher tablet but what I got was BETTER!!!This stuff cleans my dishes way better than any other brand of dish tablets I have ever used!!!The ""waste of plastic"" isn't an issue for me... and yes, you have to remove the plastic off of each one... it's not that big of a deal.. some people complain about anything!!GET THESE!! They work!!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These were a decent value imo, but my goal was to find a plastic free product and these are wrapped in plastic. I was hoping that they, like similar products by Blueland and Tyrtl, would use compostable packaging at least. Could just ship *naked* tablets! Isn’t it funny how we’re asking for less and paying for more? 🤣🤔",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These work well, but why wrap them individually? It's a waste of time and wrapper, not very eco-conscious.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I bought this product because we have a septic tank and I want to live greener. It smells better than the recommended Finish Quantum pods and it works just as well.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Surprised how effective the soap is and my dishes came out clean and shiny.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I’m not even kidding, my copper pots look like they’re brand new… and they’re from like the 70’s. They were my husbands mothers pots. He even mentioned “how did my pots get so clean?” He thought our cleaning lady did it! Nope, it was these dishwasher pods. I love that they are safe and easy on the pocket too!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I’ve been using eCover dishwasher tablets for a couple of years now after looking for a non-toxic alternative.  To my surprise, these dishwasher tabs worked far better than when I used Cascade!  I no longer prewash my dishes - I wipe off any food and they come out sparkling clean!  I also heat up my water by running the tap before starting my dishwasher.  It took a few washes for the calcium buildup in my washer to disappear but once it did, I never looked back.  Fabulous product!",positive,dishwashing tablet
Just used for the first time and I am thrilled (just ordered more!) with its performance! I had been using 7th Generation which worked well but was costly. My new go to for sure!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"I decided to buy these pods online instead of in-store because the price was about the same & I figured it was one less thing to tote home. However, as you can see at the bottom of the picture, 3 of the pods leaked their liquid & the entire batch and inside of the box were wet. I have been buying this product for years & have never encountered ""leaking"" pods. I can only assume that the shipping & handling or perhaps cold temperatures enroute caused the pods to leak. Regardless, I probably won't purchase these online again. Fortunately I discovered this problem before the moisture comprised all of the pods. I'm leaving them set out to dry before putting them back in the box. Otherwise, the product was normal.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I'm on I believe my 4th or 5th buy again purchase. Always great quality and works perfectly. The price is slightly lower than stores around here and it comes straight to my door. I call that a great deal.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Love this product! Easy to throw in dishwasher and know your dishes will come out clean and rinsed well with NO streaks,positive,dishwashing tablet
Great product and Great Value,positive,dishwashing tablet
Dissolves easy. Good product,positive,dishwashing tablet
Work great. Clean well. Good scent.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Like to use pods instead of liquid, for ease.  Price is right and delivery to my door.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Pods fit easily in my dishwashers detergent dispenser. Tub stores neatly under sink right beside the dishwasher. Pots and pans and dishes all equally clean.,positive,dishwashing tablet
I mean they're dishwasher packs. Cleans well enough.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Used to work for the company that mfr this.  Is good stuff, especially when getting it at the company store for a really low price :)  I always got the baking soda/fresh scent version and preferred it.  Supposedly DW with citrus causes rust on modern SS cutlery (chinese SS) most of my cutlery is older japanese SS which is of higher quality and not prone to rusting.  Also, I did like the baking soda/fresh scent.  I don't work for company any more, have to pay retail and it isn't cheap but it is convenient, gets the job done, And cannot detect any lemony or citrusy smell.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Amazing product partnered with my new countertop dishes. Bought based on a recommend and am so pleased bought a large container from the supermarket for a little less to include more pods.Highly recommend this. Whether leaving the dry cycle on through its entirety or air drying dishes following a wash. This combo product is totally worth the expense for spot free dishes  happy me 😁⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️💯,positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product for a good price,positive,dishwashing tablet
Always gets the dishes clean and smelling amazing. This (combined with Jet Dry) on a 1-hour cycle is our new “normal” cycle!,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Easy to use,  strong odor but doesn't reflect on dishes.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"after having some shockingly bad experiences with other brands, it feels necessary to say, this stuff works! I don't really have anything specific to add: you put it in the compartment, run the machine, voila, things come out clean and the dishwasher dissolves everything without issue! No residue, no stuck pods, no spots: it just works!",positive,dishwashing tablet
I like the product,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great buy. Pods work great but the lemon scent is too light. It says you can avoid the dry cycle but I wouldn’t, mine came out really wet! I like that the pods were “fresh” so to speak, ie, not hard, disintegrated well.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"We've tried a lot of brands, but this brand is not only economical, but ecologically safe as well. Cleans dishes without spotting. We ran out the other day and borrowed some dishwashing liquid, was the worst thing, Dishes were foggy and not thoroughly cleaned. Had to wash again, but Ecover fixed the problem.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"These are the only dishwasher pods I use, and I panic when they're not available. They remove tea stains completely from white mugs. They remove dried-on egg yolk from bowls and stainless steel pans. They remove cooking residue from frying pans. And the easier stuff is obviously gone too--grease, tomato sauce, cheese, dried-on yogurt, stuck-on rice, etc. I've tried other brands, and they always fail with the tea stains, if not more. Who cares if I have to unwrap the pod? It's less effort than scrubbing off dishes that didn't get clean, and it saves the water from that extra washing. It's a win for me. Please don't stop making these. My local store no longer carries them.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Product works really well, but tablets come individually wrapped in plastic. Made me a little sad for a brand with “eco” in its name.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"After trying my first box of these dishwasher tablets, I have made them a staple in my kitchen. Does a great job cleaning my dishes, and I can feel better knowing there are no harsh chemicals going into my septic system and ground.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"We've used these dishwasher tabs for years. They are the most effective ""eco""option that we tried and they work great.  I wish that they didn't come individually wrapped in plastic.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Love it since I use it for the first time! Never had disappointed,positive,dishwashing tablet
"These little tablets really do the trick.  They keep my dishes very clean and clear, even in my dishwasher which isn't the best",positive,dishwashing tablet
My dishes are clean and bright. There is no chemical smell when they are done washing either. Dishwasher smells clean too.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Super disappointed in this product... For an ""Eco"" brand, to have each individual detergent pod wrapped in wasteful plastic? Having to take my dishes out of the dishwasher and scrub them with water to remove the vicious chemical smell left on them? 100% would not recommend to anyone who cares about their own health or the environment.",negative,dishwashing tablet
"At last I have found dishwasher tablets that are not perfumed. These are brilliant as there is no lingering perfume in the kitchen afterwards, which irritates my throat. They clean beautifully without the chemicals. The only downside is you cannot buy them in the shops and they are more expensive than the standard Ecover tablets.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Dishes are clean, there's no nasty perfume smell.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Good product but three times the price of supermarkets.,negative,dishwashing tablet
They get the dishes clean and I feel I’m doing my bit for the environment.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"We decided to with eco-friendly products an chose this one for our dishwasher. They work great, clean wonderfully and don’t leave any spots or residue",positive,dishwashing tablet
Good value for what you get.,positive,dishwashing tablet
"Great scent, high quality dish washer detergent that isn’t hard on the environment-which is especially important to me given our water comes from our well!",positive,dishwashing tablet
Used the Seventh Generation dishwasher pods for the first time and wanted a product without PEG. They clean the dishes great and very nice scent,positive,dishwashing tablet
"The scent is lovely and essential oil based, though it doesn't last beyond the wash cycle.  Great for allergies!  It gets your dishes clean.  There is also an unscented version.",positive,dishwashing tablet
"I wanted Ultra Power Plus like the description says. The picture of the product is not Ultra, but who would expect them to be different. Power Plus does not clean as well as Ultra  Power Plus with my water",neutral,dishwashing tablet
"I love, LOVE these dishwasher packs. My dishes come out more shinny and without as many water spots than with my NAME BRAND packs I used to use! I'll buy these again!",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Works  as well as Cascade Platinum +Oxy.I am impressed for a natural alternative to all the chemical formulas.  I did not use an extra rinse aid either.  I tried it on 2 day old ( but well scraped off ) dishes, utensils with some stuck on cheese, etc.  I expected at least alot of spots on glass and I saw maybe 4 ""ghost"" spots, barely there and I had opened the door and air dried to get a better idea of how well this worked for spotting without drying assistance.  I do have a brand new dishwasher with bottle jets, and dry boost. I usually just open the door, pull the drawers out a bit and air dry overnight once dry mode starts to save energy.( Fantastic machine by the way - GE Profile with Steam/Sani/Dry Boost, Model PDT715SYNFS ) If your water does not get hot enough,  have hard water or a dishwasher that is older and less efficient or filthy from not doing a monthly filter cleaning or at least use a dishwasher cleaning pod monthly,  you may not get my results.  I'll finish out my Cascade pods and from now on it is the more natural choice Seventh Generation Ultra Power Plus for my dishwasher. Amen !",positive,dishwashing tablet
"Had never tried this brand and ended up liking it very much, still have some I'm using. It's nice to find a new product that works well.",positive,dishwashing tablet
Crystal clear glasses . Never a foggy look or etching in the glass after the wash cycle.,positive,dishwashing tablet
Works well,positive,dishwashing tablet
"This is good, but it is not quite as strong as the tablets.",positive,dishwashing tablet
I prefer the liquid over the power packs. Less residue on my dishes and it cleans great!,positive,dishwashing tablet
I found the packed powder packets do not dissolve fully in my dishwasher. This works wonders and meets my expectations. Difficult to find in stores.,positive,dishwashing tablet
nice product,positive,dishwashing tablet
Best dishwasher soap-  love it!,positive,dishwashing tablet
